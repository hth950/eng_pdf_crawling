        "1": "《Getting Off to a Good Start》\nHigh school is the best time to spark your curiosity and passion.\nYou can explore, try new things, and learn more about yourself.\nThe three years pass quickly, so use this time wisely to set yourself up for the future.\nHere are a few ways to do just that.",
        "2": "《Establish an Exercise Routine》\nMaking time for exercise with a busy schedule is not easy.\nHowever, it's important to exercise regularly because it offers countless benefits.\nYou can have more new experiences and complete more challenging tasks with increased energy.\nThe benefits are not limited to physical strength; exercise also boosts confidence and fosters a positive attitude.\nWhether you like lifting weights at the gym, jogging through the park, or riding a bicycle, establishing and sticking to an exercise routine will strengthen your body, mind, and spirit.",
        "3": "《Connect with a Role Model》\nChoosing your career path is one of the most important decisions you can make, and having a role model can be a powerful tool for making your dreams come true.\nLooking into the lives of the people you admire can be an inspiration in itself.\nYour role model can be someone you know personally, such as a teacher or family member, or someone you admire, such as a famous athlete or artist.\nIf you pick someone in your social circle, you can directly ask for their guidance.\nIf it is someone you can't meet in person, you can study their actions and observe their strategies.\nWhat you learn from them will benefit you both during and long after high school.",
        "4": "《Give the Technology a Break》\nThese days, many teenagers spend too much time staring at smartphones and computer screens.\nSome even stay up late playing computer games and watching videos.\nThis is fine as long as these devices enrich your life.\nHowever, excessive reliance on technology can exhaust your mental energy.\nTo make it easier to focus on important things, set aside your devices for some time.\nFor example, it's a good idea to finish surfing the Internet, watching videos, and sending instant messages during the week and turn everything off on the weekends.\nYou can use your newly found time to connect with friends, family, and yourself.\nYou might be surprised at how much more productive you can be when not glued to a screen.",
        "5": "《Write a Letter to Your Future Self》\nWho you are now says a lot about who you'll be in the future.\nHowever, as the years pass, some of your current interests and perspectives may fade.\nYou could try sending a note to your future self.\nWriting a letter to your future self will allow you to take a moment to reflect on where you are, where you're heading, and what's important to you right now.\nFurthermore, when you're older, this letter can serve as a reminder of the person you used to be.\nIt might even give you a new sense of strength to live a more meaningful life.\nThe high school years can be overwhelming at times, but the challenge is there for a reason, and you don't have to be perfect every step of the way.\nDuring your high school days, have a great time trying out different things and discovering what works best for you.\nMore importantly, however, don't forget to have fun along the way!"

        "1": "《It's All Greek to Me》\nHave you heard the expression, \"It's Greek to me\"?\nIt means \"I can't understand what you are saying because it sounds like a foreign language to me.\"\nYou may wonder why it is not French or Italian but Greek.\nThe reason is that the Ancient Greeks had an enormous influence on Western culture.\nGreece was the birthplace of Classical Western civilization, and therefore, also left us with some pretty great idioms.\nIdioms pose a special challenge in language learning because their meanings are different from the words that make them up.\nLearning their origins will make it easier to understand what they mean and to figure out how to use them.\nHere are four English idioms with Greek origins.",
        "2": "《Achilles' Heel》\nAccording to Homer, the Ancient Greek poet, the Greeks and Trojans had a war that lasted ten years.\nThis war eventually became known as the Trojan War, where Achilles became the most famous hero.\nWhen Achilles was born, his mother, a goddess of water, attempted to make him immortal.\nShe dipped him in the magical River Styx.\nWherever the water touched, the part touched would become indestructible.\nHowever, because she held him upside down by one of his heels, Achilles' heel remained dry.\nThis became his only weak spot.\nAchilles grew up to be a great warrior and survived many great battles.\nHowever, during the Trojan War, Paris, a prince of Troy, shot a poisoned arrow that struck Achilles' heel, which led to his death.\nThis is why the idiom \"Achilles' heel\" refers to a fatal weakness, especially in a situation where all other parts are strong.",
        "3": "《Trojan Horse》\nEven after the death of Achilles, the Trojan War reached a point where no one could win.\nOne day, the Greeks came up with an idea.\nThey built a big wooden horse and left it outside the city of Troy.\nThey pretended to leave the horse behind as a gift for the Trojans.\nThe Trojans thought they had won, so they pulled the horse inside their city gates.\nHowever, the Greeks had hidden their soldiers inside the horse.\nThat night, the soldiers came out of the horse and opened the gates to let in the Greek army waiting outside.\nThis allowed the Greeks to win the war.\nNowadays, people use the idiom \"Trojan horse\" to describe a trick or scheme that is used to hide someone's true purpose or intention.",
        "4": "《Cut the Gordian Knot》\nGreek legend tells of the Gordian Knot, which was tied by a king named Gordius.\nThe knot was so complex that no one was able to untie it.\nA prophet said whoever could untie the knot would become the ruler of Asia.\nFor hundreds of years, people unsuccessfully tried to untie the knot.\nThen, Alexander the Great came along.\nHe tried to untie it, and it just got tighter.\nAfter thinking for a while, he drew his sword and cut the knot in half!\nEveryone was shocked because that was not what they had expected.\nHe explained, \"It doesn't matter how the knot was untied.\nThe important thing is that it's undone.\"\nFrom that day on, the idiom \"cutting the Gordian knot\" has been commonly used to describe a simple solution to a complex problem.",
        "5": "《Spill the Beans》\nIn ancient Greece, people often discussed important matters and made decisions through voting.\nThey cast votes by dropping a white or black bean into a clay jar.\nWhite beans were used for positive votes, and black beans for negative votes.\nThese votes were cast in secret, so if someone knocked over the jar, whether by accident or on purpose, they spilled the beans and revealed the results of the vote prematurely.\nBecause of this origin, the phrase \"spill the beans\" came to mean \"reveal information that was meant to be kept secret.\"\nIdioms are an important part of everyday English, and they make the language rich and colorful.\nWhen you run into idioms that are \"Greek to you,\" take the time to study their origins.\nIt is a fun way to increase your understanding of English, and it can also help you to remember them and use them in the appropriate situations going forward."

        "1": "《The Chemistry of Happiness》\nWhen we ask ourselves what makes us happy, we often think of the circumstances we are in, what we have, or whom we are with.\nFrom a biological point of view, however, happiness is largely a chemical experience.\nFour main brain chemicals are responsible for creating the sensations and emotions we associate with happiness: endorphins, serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin.\nIt is good news for us that happiness can be controlled.\nEven when our lives aren't exactly what we would like them to be, we can improve our mood by engaging in pleasant and healthy activities that increase the amounts of these happiness chemicals.\nLet's take a deeper dive into what each of these chemicals does and how we can increase their levels.",
        "5": "《Oxytocin: The Love Hormone》\nOxytocin is often called the \"love hormone\" because it promotes social bonding and trust.\nIt is mainly associated with loving touches and close relationships.\nOxytocin will be released when you are connecting with people, and it reduces your stress level and calms down your nervous system.\nSpending time with friends and loved ones is a great way to raise your oxytocin levels.\nGiving or receiving a massage, shaking hands, or hugging can lead to higher levels of oxytocin as well.\nIf you have a pet, you can increase oxytocin for both yourself and your pet by hugging your little friend.\nYou may have heard the saying \"Happiness depends on your attitude, not on what you have.\"\nEndorphins, serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin help promote happiness, and you can give these happiness chemicals a natural boost with simple activities.\nWe cannot always choose the situations we find ourselves in, but we can certainly choose what to do for ourselves.\nThere's a lot we can do to boost the happiness chemicals in our brains.\nThis means that we have control of our own happiness!",
        "2": "《Endorphins: The Pain Relievers》\nEndorphins are natural pain relievers.\nThey are \"feel-good\" chemicals because they can make you feel better and put you in a positive state of mind.\nWhen our body feels pain or stress, the brain releases endorphins to block the nerve cells that receive the pain signals.\nThis essentially turns off your pain, helping you continue functioning, even in painful and stressful situations.\nThe most well-known way to increase endorphins is through slightly challenging exercise which makes you a little short of breath.\nResearch shows that about twenty to thirty minutes of exercise can help boost your endorphin levels significantly.\nAnother way is to have a good laugh.\nShare funny videos, tell jokes, and laugh with your friends.\nWe don't laugh because we are happy; we are happy because we laugh.",
        "3": "《Serotonin: The Mood Balancer》\nSerotonin is another brain chemical that plays a key role in balancing our mood.\nIt provides feelings of happiness and also helps decrease our worries and concerns.\nWhen you feel happy and all seems right with the world, you are feeling the effects of serotonin.\nSerotonin is made from the essential amino acid tryptophan, which must enter our body through our diet.\nTherefore, eating foods rich in tryptophan like chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts can boost your body's natural ability to make serotonin.\nFurthermore, good habits like getting more sunshine and going on short walks can do wonders for boosting your levels of serotonin.",
        "4": "《Dopamine: The Reward Chemical》\nDopamine is an important chemical for motivation.\nIt is called the \"reward chemical\" because it rewards the brain with happy feelings for meeting goals and achieving things.\nWe can also feel a dopamine rush when we imagine a future achievement.\nIn both cases, dopamine gives us feelings of joy and satisfaction, encouraging us to seek out more goals and find new challenges.\nChoosing food higher in protein can be a good way to increase your dopamine levels naturally, because it can only be made with the amino acid tyrosine, which is found in many proteins.\nGetting regular, high-quality sleep may also help keep your dopamine levels balanced and help you feel more alert during the day.\nMeditation has also been shown to increase dopamine levels.\nThis, in turn, leads to improved focus and concentration."

        "2": "《Day 1. First Impressions of London》\nWalking around the area we were staying in, I couldn't help but notice several signs along the streets that read, \"TO LET.\"\nAt first, I assumed that these signs were missing the letter \"I\", and that the UK was incredibly toilet friendly.\nI excitedly shared my thoughts with my brother, mentioning that it seemed like London had many public restrooms.\nHe explained that \"TO LET\" actually means \"for rent\" in British English.\nIt was one of the funny moments that left us all laughing!",
        "3": "《Day 2. The British Museum》\nAfter having breakfast, we headed to the British Museum.\nIt has impressive collections from all over the world.\nI was delighted to see the world-famous Rosetta Stone.\nI read in the world history textbook that it was the most important clue for understanding the ancient Egyptian writing system.\nOur exploration continued, and it led us to a display of Egyptian mummies.\nWitnessing ancient mummies in person was a fascinating experience.\nHowever, I felt a sense of sympathy for these mummies being exhibited in front of foreigners in an unfamiliar land.",
        "4": "Next, we explored the Greek Parthenon temple and its sculptures.\nWhile the temple itself is a copy, some stones and many statues were actually brought from Greece.\nThe statues made of smooth white marble were elegant and beautiful.\nAfter a coffee break at the Queen Elizabeth II court under the beautiful roof, we stopped by the Chinese Gallery on our way to the Korean Gallery.\nThe ancient Chinese warriors, all riding clay horses, were fascinating.\nWhen we stepped into the Korean Gallery, my attention was immediately captured by a sarangbang.\nSeeing the sarangbang made from trees taken from Korea surprised and delighted me.\nAs I looked around, a sense of pride filled me to see people from different countries appreciating Korean arts and crafts, such as the moon jar.\nA visit to the British Museum was indeed a journey through time and across the continents.",

        "6": "If the morning had been for my dad and his books, the later half of the day was about my mom's love for afternoon tea.\nStepping into the tea room, I felt a bit uneasy due to the elegant atmosphere.\nHowever, this feeling quickly faded away when we were presented with a generous pot of tea and a three-level stand filled with delicious treats.\nI used to think that having afternoon tea was an expensive, unnecessary luxury.\nHowever, enjoying afternoon tea with my family at such an elegant place made me feel like a noble lady.\nMoreover, being able to share stories with my family made the experience truly meaningful.",
        "7": "《Day 4. A Musical in the West End》\nEver since I was in the musical club in my middle school, I've loved to watch musicals.\nI was thrilled to watch the original cast version of my favorite musical in its hometown of London.\nI could not take my eyes off of the magical sets and elaborate costumes.\nThe powerful voices of two leading ladies in particular were out of this world!\nSadly, my English wasn't good enough to follow some parts of the musical, and I couldn't always enjoy a laugh with others.\nHowever, it was still a really great experience.\nNo vacation lasts forever, and I eventually had to return to Korea.\nI enjoyed every aspect of my London trip.\nWhat I liked most about London was the variety.\nFrom exploring the historical bookstore to experiencing the magic of musical theater, there was something for everyone in my family to enjoy.\nLondon has truly captured our hearts, and I can't wait to visit more of London's most interesting places."

        "2": "《Day 1》\nFull of excitement and anticipation, I began my journey at Heunginjimun Gate, the gate on the east side of the wall.\nNot far from there was the Seoul City Wall Museum.\nI stopped by this museum to learn all about the history of the wall before I started my walk.\nThen I passed through Ihwa Maeul, a village that was home to refugees following the Korean War.\nNow, the village is decorated with colorful wall paintings and sculptures.\nI was pleasantly surprised by the creativity of the artists.\nThey have turned the village into a delightful place where visitors can enjoy art everywhere they look.\nAfter looking around in this charming little village, I crossed over Naksan Mountain, which is the lowest of Seoul's four inner mountains.\nNaksan Mountain is also known as \"Naktasan Mountain,\" or \"Camel Mountain,\" because of its resemblance to a camel's back.\nAt last, I finished my walk at Hyehwamun Gate, one of the wall's four smaller gates.\nThanks to Naksan Mountain's gentle slope, the day's walk ended up being pleasurable and relatively easy.",
        "3": "《Day 2》\nThe following day, my trip started from the Malbawi Information Center at the bottom of Bugaksan Mountain.\nThis mountain is quite steep, so my progress was a lot slower than expected.\nHowever, it wasn't long before I found myself gazing at the spectacular view from the mountain's 342-meter summit.\nThere, I spent some time looking upon the amazing panorama of Seoul, with its endless high-rise buildings stretching out below me.\nWith my heart pumping, I continued my trek on the section of the wall over Inwangsan Mountain, which is famous for its wide variety of unusual rock formations.\nI was especially impressed by the tremendous size and unique shape of Seonbawi Rock, or \"rock of the meditating monk.\"\nThe path then split from the original route of the wall, but I was able to rejoin it at the site of what was once Donuimun Gate, one of the main gates.\nAlthough it was destroyed in 1915, the site is now marked by a wood and glass terrace.\nFinally, I came back to modern-day Seoul.\nMy feet were sore, but I felt truly refreshed after walking along the roof of the city and taking in such marvelous views.",

        "3": "《Luxury Hotel in the Netherlands》\nAnother spectacular example of adaptive reuse can be seen in this beautiful hotel in the Netherlands, which blends its own unique history with modern functionality.\nThe building was one of the Netherlands' most infamous prisons from 1863 until 2007.\nHowever, it has undergone a complete transformation into luxurious accommodations.\nThe building originally had 105 prison cells, but these have been converted into 40 luxurious rooms.\nThe rooms have been updated with modern furnishings, but details like exposed brick, barred windows, and original cell doors offer clues about its past.\nIf you need extra space, suite rooms with names like The Judge, The Lawyer, The Jailer, and The Director are available.\nGuests can even enjoy a special dinner while slides of the jail's history are shown.\nThey are given black and white striped jail hats to get into the mood.\nThis hotel used to be a place from which people desperately wanted to escape, but with some creative thinking, it has been turned into a place guests never want to leave.",
        "4": "《Tropical Theme Park in Germany》\nPeople living in Berlin who are eager to escape from the bitter cold of winter are now in luck.\nNear the city, a huge hangar for manufacturing airships has become a theme park where the sun always shines and the temperature remains a mild 26 degrees Celsius.\nThe hangar fell into disuse because the company that owned it went bankrupt in 2002.\nHowever, a company in Malaysia looked at this massive deserted dome and saw great potential.\nIn 2004, the hangar opened as a tropical theme park.\nMeasuring about 66,000 square meters, the dome is tall enough to fit the Statue of Liberty inside.\nIt contains the world's largest artificial rainforest, with more than 50,000 plants.\nThe indoor pool is the size of four Olympic swimming pools, and the waterslide is nine stories tall.\nIn the southern section of the dome, a special foil roof produces artificial sunlight, so visitors can get a tan even in the middle of winter!\nBy looking at the enormous dome with new eyes, a company was able to turn this huge space into an amazing vacation spot.\nAdaptive reuse helps us preserve our heritage while allowing for new creative developments at the same time.\nEach of these remarkable destinations shows that by changing our point of view, we can breathe new life into old, abandoned buildings.",
        "5": "《GPS: Born from a Change in Perspective》\nFor thousands of years, humans had difficulty trying to figure out where they were.\nSo, they devoted a great deal of time and effort to resolving this problem.\nThey drew complicated maps, constructed great landmarks to keep themselves on the right path, and even learned to navigate by looking up at the stars.\nNowadays, it is much easier to find out where you are and which way to go because you have one of the world's greatest inventions at your fingertips.\nAs long as you have a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, you never have to worry about taking a wrong turn.\nYour GPS receiver can tell you your exact location and give you directions to wherever you need to go, no matter where you are on the planet!\nBut how was this amazing technology invented?",
        "6": "The story begins in 1957, when the Soviet Union shocked the world by announcing that it had launched Sputnik 1—the world's first man-made satellite — into orbit.\nIn particular, two researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, were amazed by this achievement.\nFilled with curiosity, they built a listening station the following year, and they began to closely monitor Sputnik 1's radio signal.\nWhile listening to the persistent sound from the satellite, they noticed something interesting: its radio frequency repeatedly became higher and lower.\nThis was happening because the frequency of a radio signal rises and falls depending on whether the satellite is moving toward or away from the listener.\nBy keeping track of these changes, Guier and Weiffenbach were able to determine the satellite's precise location.",
        "7": "Although Guier and Weiffenbach found this fascinating, tracking satellites was not exactly part of their duties.\nTheir director, Frank McClure, called them into his office, suspecting that they had been wasting their time.\nHe asked them to explain the thing they had been working on.\nAs Guier and Weiffenbach explained themselves, an idea flashed through McClure's mind.\n\"If we can figure out where the satellite is,\" McClure said, \"then can't we do the opposite and use the satellite to figure out where we are?\"\nThis turned out to be a revolutionary insight.\nNot only could radio signals be measured to track a satellite from the ground, but by measuring the distance from the satellite to the receiver, the receiver's precise location could be determined as well.\nThis is the fundamental concept behind modern GPS.\nSatellites are utilized to transmit signals, and any device with a GPS receiver can use these signals to calculate where you are, how high you are, and even how fast you are moving.\nMcClure was able to come up with this brilliant insight by taking the idea Guier and Weiffenbach had been researching—finding where a satellite was from a known location—and turning it on its head.\nLikewise, we can produce extraordinary inventions and ideas by reversing our perspective.\nThe real act of discovery, it has been said, consists not in seeking new lands, but in seeing things with new eyes!"

        "1": "《Florence Nightingale: Saving Lives with Statistics》\nWhen you think of Florence Nightingale, you probably picture a lady with a lamp taking care of injured and ill soldiers.\nHer compassion for these people was clearly seen through her acts.\nOn the other hand, her passion for statistics as a way to save people's lives is not well known to many people.\nIn October 1853, the conflict between Russia and an alliance of European countries turned into a war in the Turkish region known as Crimea.\nThe war lasted from October 1853 to March 1856 and resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries.\nHoping to contribute her skills to help the British troops fighting in the Crimean War, Nightingale accepted a nursing position at an army base in Scutari, Turkey in 1854.",
        "2": "Upon her arrival at the base in Scutari, Nightingale realized how difficult it would be to provide proper medical care at the base.\nEssential supplies such as food, basic furniture, and blankets were not sufficient, and sometimes nonexistent.\nPatients had to deal with inadequate sanitation, which was worsened by exposure to rats and fleas.\nFurthermore, the medical records were extremely disorganized.\nThat was because none of the hospitals were using the same reporting system as any of the others.\nEach hospital had a different system of naming and classifying diseases, and even the number of deaths was not accurate.\nThus, Nightingale dedicated herself not only to serving the needs of the injured and ill soldiers directly but also to improving the record-keeping of the hospitals.\nShe introduced the practice of recording the cause of each death in a uniform manner, which had not been done previously.\nAfter witnessing many tragic deaths during the war, Nightingale knew that the only way to prevent unnecessary deaths was to improve sanitary conditions in army hospitals.\nTherefore, she decided to persuade army officials and politicians that widespread sanitation reform was necessary.\nWith the help of William Farr, a leading statistician at the time, Nightingale made a number of reports based on the information she had gathered during the war.\nShe knew that her message might easily get lost in a long list of tables.\nSo, in an attempt to communicate the information in a more effective way, she developed a unique graph: the polar area graph.",
        "3": "The polar area graph presented a great deal of information about the causes of death of British soldiers in Crimea at a glance.\nEach of the twelve sectors displayed on the graph represented a different month.\nThe size of the sector showed how many deaths occurred that month, with the largest sectors indicating the months with the highest death rates.\nWithin each sector, three colors were used to show the cause of death.\nThe blue section represented deaths attributed to infectious diseases like cholera.\nThe pink section showed deaths caused by wounds, most of which were received in combat.\nBlack stood for deaths caused by anything other than diseases or wounds.",
        "4": "Nightingale analyzed this data and tried to figure out ways to lower the number of deaths.\nFor example, she made efforts to improve air flow in hospitals and develop safer ways to process sewage during the war.\nHer efforts resulted in a sharp drop in deaths caused by contagious diseases.\nThis can be seen on the graph in the months where the blue section nearly disappears.\nThrough her graphs, Nightingale effectively demonstrated the substantial impact that contagious diseases had on the soldiers in the army hospital.\nIn fact, infectious disease would have wiped out the entire army if the trend had continued.\nBy showing her message in such a clear way, however, she was able to convince people that a large number of deaths could be prevented.\nAs a consequence, sanitation procedures used by hospitals underwent extensive reforms, and the number of preventable deaths decreased sharply.\nThanks to her effective tools of communication, she made a crucial and lasting impact in the fields of both medicine and statistics.",
        "5": "《Gestures across the Globe》\nImagine that you are abroad and you are looking for a restroom.\nThe problem is you don't speak the language.\nWhat would you do in this situation?\nYou would probably try to use your hands, arms, face, head, or any other parts of your body to deliver your message.\nWhen you encounter a language barrier, gestures are an obvious alternative to illustrate your points.\nThese movements may seem like the simplest way to communicate, but a gesture in one culture might not have the same meaning as that gesture in another culture.\nIn other words, your gestures may seem like nonsense to others, so they might think you are weird.\nOn some occasions, they might feel offended by your gestures even if you didn't mean to cause offense.",
        "6": "For instance, nodding your head means \"yes\" in most cultures, but you should be cautious because this is not universal.\nIn Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria, a head nod actually means \"no.\"\nIn Japan, it carries another meaning.\nA nod given by a Japanese person signifies that he or she is listening and wants you to continue speaking.\nEven if the Japanese person does not agree with your opinion, he or she will still nod to keep the conversation going.\nThis can be a source of misunderstanding when the speaker thinks a nod means \"I agree with you,\" but it actually means \"I want to hear more.\"\nThe movements themselves are not the only thing that can vary across cultures.\nThe frequency with which a person uses gestures is also influenced by his or her culture.\nExaggerated gestures for emphasis and explanations are common in certain cultures.\nFor example, people in France, Spain, and Italy have a tendency to use a lot of gestures when speaking.\nIn fact, hand gestures are so important for Italians that they might even pull off the road while driving to continue a conversation.\nIt is nearly impossible for them to talk without using their hands.",
        "7": "On the contrary, there are many cultures where the use of gestures is highly restricted.\nSpeakers in England, Germany, and some other northern European countries seem stiff and frozen compared to their southern neighbors.\nIn some parts of East Asia, body movement is kept to a minimum as a sign of politeness.\nIn fact, excessive gestures can be considered aggressive in these cultures.\nOwing to these differences, these people may consider those who use a lot of gestures to be rude and lack self-control.\nOn the other hand, those who use many gestures may find those who don't dull and restrained.\nEffective communication is not just about verbal communication but also about the gestures we use.\nMaking mere assumptions about a person's intentions based on gestures can cause misunderstandings if we do not take into account the person's cultural background.\nHence, understanding cultural differences in gesture use can help us improve communication and avoid confusion or offense."

        "2": "While others on the tour collected gifts at each place they visited, Adam did something different.\nHe wanted to know the people who lived in that place, so he decided he would ask one child per country, \"If you could have anything in the world, what would you want most?\"\nHe was surprised at the answers he received – never a computer, a TV, or a car, but \"to dance,\" \"a book,\" or \"for my mother to be well.\"\nOne of the answers in particular surprised him and eventually led him to change the course of his life.\n\"A pencil.\" It was a reply from a boy in India.\nHe wanted an education, a chance to become different.\nRealizing that he could change a child's life and open a world of possibilities with something as small as a pencil, Adam began carrying a pack of pencils and giving them to children along the way.\nWhenever he gave out pencils, the children seemed to come alive, delighted to have a chance to learn.\nThat was the start of Adam's plan to build schools for people who want to get an education but who cannot afford one.\nCharity should be not about just giving to the poor and creating a cruel cycle of dependence but about enabling them, Adam thought.",

        "4": "When Adam and Pencils of Promise started building their first school in Laos, the Lao government promised to send teachers to the school after its completion.\nThe local villagers promised to contribute to its construction.\nBecause they had little money, they instead supplied raw materials and labor.\nWhen Adam saw two elderly ladies carrying a heavy piece of wood, he went over to try to tell them they might hurt themselves.\nThey smiled and said something to Adam.\nThe translator told Adam that they had been waiting their whole lives for this opportunity to have a school.\nOne day, during the construction period, three shy little girls approached Adam to say hello.\nHe could recognize the joy on their faces.\nThey were really happy to have the opportunity to go to school.\nAdam recorded the girls on his video recorder, and the video spread quickly on social media, leading to comments and emails from friends and strangers alike asking how they could get involved in giving this joy to children across the world.",

        "1": "Moderator: Welcome to our show.\nToday, we're going to talk about the artistic tradition of Korea.\nWe have invited special guests with expertise in this matter, the museum curator Choi Sora, the architect Yu Min, and the hanbok master Kim Hyejin.\nThank you all for joining us.\nMs. Choi, what do you think are the most important qualities that define the traditional Korean arts?\n《Harmony with Nature》\nChoi Sora (Curator): I believe the beauty of the Korean artistic tradition lies in a combination of its naturalness and its origin in our ancestors' genuine love of nature.\nKoreans have always sought to live in harmony with nature.\nThis love of nature is expressed not only in works of art but also in the daily lives of all Koreans.\nYu Min (Architect): I agree. Traditional Korean gardens are a good example.\nWhile Chinese and Japanese gardens focus on the beauty of a highly fabricated landscape, Korean gardens use little in the way of artificial decoration.\nThis reflects Koreans' wish to be united with nature.\nFor example, the walls of Soswaewon in Damyang were built to let the natural stream flow down the rocks so as not to spoil the landscape.\nAs a result, it looks like the garden is an original part of the surrounding nature.",
        "2": "Moderator: Soswaewon is certainly a wonderful example of a typical Korean garden.\nWhat Korean building or structure would you say is a good architectural example that emphasizes harmony with its surroundings?\nYu Min (Architect): There are many.\nAmong them, Changdeokgung is known for its effort to accommodate the natural world in its palace garden.\nThe palace buildings go so well with the low hills, valleys, and thick forests that it is difficult to tell the natural space from the artificial palace buildings.\nFor these reasons, in 1997, it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe deliberating committee praised Changdeokgung highly for the unique beauty of its creative and free layout depicting harmony with nature.\nModerator: I remember visiting Huwon, the rear garden of Changdeokgung.\nI was there for only a short while before I felt I was becoming one with nature and found an inner peace.",
        "3": "《Gentle Curved Lines》\nChoi Sora (Curator): I'd like to point out that gentle curved lines also characterize the Korean sense of beauty.\nThe white porcelain of the Joseon Dynasty is a fine example.\nIn contrast with Chinese porcelain, with its bold straight lines and extreme curves, Joseon porcelain expresses gentler curves that remind us of the Korean landscape.\nYu Min (Architect): In fact, the curved line is also one of the key features of traditional Korean architecture.\nFor example, nothing speaks better to the beauty of a hanok than the line of its roof.\nIts design is meant to run parallel to the curves of the mountain behind it.\nIt looks rhythmic and lively as if it were the shape of a crane folding its wings when it is about to land.\nThis naturally curved line conveys stability and is comforting to the eye.",
        "4": "Kim Hyejin (Hanbok Master): We can also see curved lines in hanbok.\nWhen discussing hanbok, the beauty of its flowing lines cannot be stressed enough.\nThis is the attribute that differentiates hanbok from other East Asian traditional costumes, such as the Chinese chipao or the Japanese kimono.\nThe jeogori is especially rich in subtle curves, as shown in the collar and the sleeves.\nKorean hanbok incorporates both straight and curved lines, which are combined to create a sense of naturally flowing harmony.\nModerator: Whenever I wear hanbok, I am pleased because the elegant lines complement the shape of my body.\nKim Hyejin (Hanbok Master): Hanbok has a very simple shape when laid out flat.\nWhen worn, however, it creates a lot of soft lines following the natural curves of our body.\nIts unique flowing lines reveal themselves best when the wearer moves.",
        "5": "《Simplicity》\nModerator: In addition to harmony with nature and gentle curves, is there anything else that is a major attribute of the Korean artistic tradition?\nChoi Sora (Curator): Simplicity is another main characteristic of our traditional sense of beauty.\nMany Korean artworks are designed to boldly leave out details and focus on the bigger picture.\nThis simple approach, combined with exceptional craftsmanship, resulted in excellent works of art.\nOne notable example is the moon jar of the late Joseon Dynasty.\nThe moon jar, which is a Tangible Cultural Property of Korea, is a plain white jar with no pattern or decoration.\nIn fact, most of the artworks from the late Joseon Dynasty are simple in appearance, likely due to the influence of Confucianism which advocated moderation.\nModerator: Thank you for your valuable comments and opinions.\nNow, it's time to wrap up the discussion.\nWe've learned that the beauty of the Korean artistic tradition is characterized by harmony with nature, gentle curved lines, and simplicity.\nLet us continue the effort to preserve the beautiful artistic traditions of our country.",
        "6": "《Lee Leenam: Traditional with Modern Technique》\nLee Leenam is an internationally noted Korean media artist whose work owes its inspiration to the work by Paik Namjune, the pioneer of video art.\nLee Leenam is known for inventively recreating well-known European paintings, such as the \"Mona Lisa\" by Leonardo da Vinci or \"The Lunch on the Grass\" by Edouard Manet.\nWith his touches, the Mona Lisa makes a bigger smile and the surroundings of Manet's painting are transformed into a Korean landscape.\nThe characters and backgrounds in the paintings are constantly making lively movements, which produce visual illusions that, while keeping the impression of the original work, turn the traditional painting into an interactive one.\nHe says that he draws on classical paintings to make contemporary art friendlier for the public.\nThis is why many of his works are based also on traditional Korean paintings, which are given new life through his innovative vision.\nThe results include butterflies flying around and crossing the different screens of Shin Saimdang's \"Chochungdo,\" mountains changing their colors as the seasons pass by in Jeong Seon's landscape paintings, and the hammering sound getting louder at a traditional Korean blacksmith's shop in a painting by Kim Hongdo.",
        "7": "Standing before one of his works, viewers feel as if they were in the painting rather than outside of it, merely looking in.\nIt takes several minutes to comprehend all the differences in any of Lee Leenam's works, but most viewers cannot get enough of it and stand looking at it for a long time.\nLee Leenam's works pose the question to this audience: What do we still have to learn from these old paintings in our present age?\nThe struggle to find or create a balance between the old and the modern is perhaps the most powerful appeal of his work."

        "4": "Tashi then took us to see a group of dancers in colorful costumes performing a traditional folk dance outdoors.\nThey were accompanied by Bhutanese folk musicians playing folk songs.\nShe told us that it is common for Bhutanese people to enjoy folk dancing at gatherings and that the lyrics of the songs are about the harmony of humans, animals, and nature.\nThe cheerful mood was so inviting that we all ended up joining the dance with a lot of other visitors from different countries.\nI felt as if I were really part of Bhutanese culture.\n《Day 3 Tiger’s Nest: Temples on a Cliff》\nThe Taktsang Monastery in Paro, also known as Tiger's Nest, is one of the most famous Buddhist monasteries in Bhutan.\nThis temple complex was built as a dedication to Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Buddhism to Bhutan.\nIt is believed that in the 8th century, a tigress brought the guru on her back to this site where he meditated for more than three years.\nMore interesting to me was the monastery's location.\nIt clings to a cliff at 3,120 meters above sea level, and is often hidden in clouds.",
        "5": "The path to the monastery was steep and narrow.\nSome tourists rode up the hill on donkeys.\nWe could have taken a donkey, but out of respect for the sacred place and the animals, we decided to walk as most Bhutanese do.\nAlthough our three hours' uphill hike left us exhausted, our effort was greatly rewarded.\nThe monastery was spectacular.\nIts four interconnected temples are the best example of the Buddhist architectural tradition in Bhutan.\nMoreover, the view of the surrounding mountains and emerald green valleys was absolutely breathtaking.\nFor my family, this trip to Bhutan was very different from any of the other trips we had taken before.\nDuring our tour, we used few modern facilities, and therefore, following Bhutan's tourism policy, we had a \"low impact\" on its precious environment.\nAlso, a great portion of our time on the tour was devoted to learning about the Bhutanese people and their culture.\nThis left me with a sense of warmth that I have rarely felt as a traveler.\nAltogether, my family agreed that this trip was one of the most memorable experiences of our lives.",

        "7": "During the 1960s and 1970s, to Serengeti lovers' regret, a severe economic depression in the country hit Serengeti National Park.\nDue to deep budget cuts, wild animals were not given enough protection against illegal hunting.\nAs a result, the elephant population declined to only a few hundred, and the rhinoceros population fell to just two individuals.\nAs the economy improved, in the 1980s, and domestic and international donations grew, park rangers were better able to protect the animals from illegal hunters.\nThe 1989 worldwide ban on ivory also helped reduce illegal hunting.\nA continuing issue concerning the Serengeti is how to achieve harmony between local villagers who kill the animals for meat and the government that wants to protect the area.\nIn an effort to resolve this issue, Wildlife Management Areas, which are locally administered game reserves, were created around Serengeti National Park."

        "2": "Surrounded by ice, the mom, dad, and baby whale were having a hard time.\nThey had to surface to breathe, but each time they surfaced, they cut themselves on the sharp edges of the ice.\nAs the story became international news, many groups responded to play a part in saving the whales, although they all had different reasons for being there.\nAmbitious news reporters used the story to further their careers.\nAn oil company offered a barge to break the ice as a way to gain favor with the public.\nThe U.S. government supported the rescue effort to earn voters' support in the coming election.\nIn contrast, the Inupiat wanted to hunt the whales, as they had done for centuries.\nThat put them in direct conflict with a Greenpeace activist named Rachel.\nRachel: Why won't you give us a chance to get them out?\nI have a barge that's just days away, but you want to kill them. How could you?\nRoy (an Inupiat): Rachel, we have to hunt!\nOne day, the oil is going to run out, and the money will stop coming.\nIf we don't teach our children how to feed themselves, they're going to starve.\nAnd who's going to feed them then? Are you?",
        "3": "As reporters flooded into Barrow from all over the world, Malik, the leader of the Inupiat tribe, realized that they would face enormous criticism if they killed the whales as the world watched.\nThat would not be good for the reputation of the tribe.\nThe native people finally changed their mind and decided to help free the whales.\nIn the end, they played an important role in the rescue because they knew how to survive in the harsh climate.\nWith this cast of characters, the rescue mission did not go smoothly at first.\nTemperatures were below freezing, and the hole in the ice that the whales breathed through was about to freeze over.\nMalik came up with a plan to cut open the ice and make small pools that the whales could access so that they could breathe until they could be led out into the open sea.\nAlthough it was a process that would take a long time, he persuaded the members of his tribe to help the whales with him.\nThey worked day and night to dig the holes.\nMalik: The whales cannot survive here.\nWe need to make a path out to open water.\nLet's start cutting holes every 20 meters.\nNathan (Malik's grandson): But what makes you think they're going to follow our path, grandpa?\nMalik: We have no choice but to try.",
        "4": "Bad news came.\nThe barge which had been the only hope to break the sheet of ice so the whales could swim out to the open sea ended up getting stuck in the ice itself.\nThey needed a bigger ice breaker.\nThis was during the period of the East-West Cold War following World War II.\nDespite the unfriendly relations between the U.S. government and the Soviet Union, the U.S. government decided to call the Soviet Union for help.\nUnexpectedly, the Soviet Navy responded positively to the request by sending a ship to help break a path for the whales.\nIn the meantime, however, the baby whale died from its injuries.\nIn deep sadness, the people all continued to work to save the two remaining whales.\nReporter: The clock continues to tick down as crews work furiously to cut a path to the open ocean.\nThe town of Barrow has shut down as school children and shop owners alike answer the call to help out on the ice in any way they can.\nThose who are not cutting holes are providing hot food and coffee to the workers.",

        "7": "Due to excessive hunting, by the early 1900s, the number of gray whales had decreased to fewer than 2,000 individuals.\nA 1946 international agreement to stop hunting them helped them return to their previous population level.\nWithout the agreement, gray whales would have become extinct.\nRecently, an increasing number of gray whales have been found dead on seashores.\nOne possible cause for these deaths is that they are starving as a result of El Nino, which decreases the food they feed on.\nAnother possibility is that their population could have outgrown its food resources.\nMany organizations and volunteers are making coordinated efforts to monitor gray whales and collect information to better understand the causes of the population decline."

        "1": "When a computer equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) beat the world Go champion in Seoul in early 2016, the worries about AI were noticeably increased.\nWith its development taking place so fast, many people are worried that robots equipped with AI could soon fill positions currently held by humans, leaving many of us in desperate circumstances.\nOptimists about AI's development, on the other hand, believe that it will greatly improve our quality of life by helping to cure diseases and solve difficult problems humans are battling with, such as meeting the world's food and energy needs.\nNo one can be sure of what the future may hold, but one thing is certain: AI will have an enormous impact on life as we know it.\nThis is why AI deserves our serious attention.\nBefore we examine its possible impact on our future, we need to have a proper understanding of AI.\nWhat is AI?\nAI is software designed to perceive information and apply it towards solving problems within a given context, in a similar way to how human intelligence does.\nThere are three major types of AI based on capacity.",
        "2": "Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), or Weak AI, is AI that specializes in one task.\nIt can search for information, filter out unwanted emails, translate short sentences to another language, or play Go.\nIt equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency in its specific task, but cannot do much more than that.\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI), or Strong AI, is AI that is as smart as a human in almost all areas.\nIt will be able to reason, plan, understand complex concepts, and learn from experience.\nCreating AGI is much more difficult because the human brain works in a very complicated way.\nStill, scientists are making progress in this area by designing better models of machine learning; in other words, letting AI learn for itself, similar to humans.\nThough at the same level as human intelligence, AGI will have great advantages over humans.\nAs to its hardware, its data storage space will be able to be expanded to any size while the brain cannot get bigger.\nAs to its software, AGI will be able to be continuously upgraded through updates and fixes.\nThrough a worldwide network of AGI, anything any single computer learned would be uploaded to all the other computers, which will make all of them smarter simultaneously.",
        "3": "AI at the last level of advancement is called Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).\nIt is supposed to be much smarter than the best human brains in almost every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.\nASI could range from a computer that is a little smarter than a human to one that is a trillion times smarter in all areas.\nASI gives rise to heated debates because, if developed, it will change our future forever by employing its enormous power.\nAs of now, we have ANI, the lowest level of AI.\nMany scientists and AI experts have different opinions about when we will have AGI.\nSome expect it to be as short as ten years, while others expect it to be half a century.\nWhat they agree on, however, is that with the rapid developments in both hardware and software taking place simultaneously, the unexpected arrival of AGI will be the likely result.\nThey also acknowledge that once an AI system reaches the level of AGI, it will not take long for it to reach the next level, that is, ASI.\nThat is because the more advanced an AI system is, the faster its advancement will be.",
        "4": "Then, what future will AI bring to humanity?\nThe optimist camp pictures a bright future in which ASI solves quickly and efficiently almost all the problems we have.\nTo reduce global warming, AI could come up with much better ways to generate energy without polluting the environment.\nThen it could create some innovative ways to remove excess CO₂ from the air.\nASI could defeat fatal diseases.\nIf a person has cancer, ASI could use nanotechnology to design special nanobots to perform surgery and manufacture drugs to kill the cancer cells without side effects.",
        "5": "Experts in the pessimistic camp express concerns about the future that ASI may bring, including the loss of jobs and in particular, ethical issues.\nMost jobs requiring a medium level of skills and involving doing routine activities can be replaced with ASI, or even AGI, leaving a large number of people jobless.\nThe resulting economic and financial instability could lead to serious social problems.\nEthical problems could also arise.\nIf a self-driving car hit a child, who would be responsible for the accident?\nYou certainly could not put the car in jail, and it would not be easy to hold the car manufacturer responsible for the accident.\nAnother concern is that if ASI is placed in the wrong hands, it could bring enormous damage to humanity or Earth.\nAI is an immensely powerful tool and will become much more powerful as time passes.\nWithout a doubt, when AI reaches the level of human intelligence, the AGI level, in the future not far from today, it will bring about a fundamental change in our lives and the world will never be the same.\nWe do not have to panic, though.\nHowever advanced AI may become, it is still computer software and cannot set its own values and make judgments.\nIt is up to us how to make it work for the benefit of humanity.",

My name is Thomas Frey and I am a futurist.\nToday, I would like to talk about future jobs and what you need to do to prepare for them.\nWith all the revolutions in technology, our future is becoming more and more like science fiction.\nFor example, by 2030, we will put on perfectly fitting 3D- printed clothes, live in a 3D- printed house, own more than one robot, and go around in a driverless car.\nThese changes will mean fewer jobs in many affected fields.\nIn fact, I predict that about 50 percent of all the jobs we know of today will disappear.\nWith machines taking over many of the occupations existing today, will we run out of jobs? Not necessarily.\nRevolutions in technology create new opportunities, just as the Industrial Revolution did in the past.\nFor example, while 3D-printed clothing will eliminate jobs in manufacturing and retailing, more designers, stylists, and engineers for 3D printers will be needed.\nIn addition, some jobs will never be replaced by robots.\nIf you want a job that only humans will be able to do, consider the arts, professional sports, or counseling.",

        "1": "We know that plastic waste harms the environment because it does not decompose naturally.\nThat is why many of us now put plastic waste into a separate bin, use a cloth bag when shopping, and have a reusable water bottle available.\nThere is a certain type of plastic, however, whose damaging effects are not yet widely known: microplastics.\n《What are microplastics?》\nMicroplastics are tiny plastic particles less than five millimeters wide.\nThey are formed from the breakdown of larger plastic waste in the seas or are industrially manufactured in two forms: microbeads and microfibers.\nMicrobeads are a very tiny form of microplastics, usually measuring less than two millimeters across.\nThey are used in hundreds of personal care products, including toothpaste, facial scrubs, and some cosmetic products.\nMicrobeads are too small to be filtered out during the waste water treatment process and therefore end up going directly into lakes, rivers, or oceans.\nMicrofibers are the synthetic materials that are used in clothes.\nMost of our clothing is made up of these tiny threads of plastic.\nAccording to one study, a single piece of synthetic clothing can release around 1,900 microfibers every time it is washed.\nThose fibers also end up in the oceans.",
        "2": "《How much plastic enters the oceans?》\nThe amount of microplastics on the surfaces of the oceans has increased significantly during the past four decades.\nConsider this: About 300 million tons of plastic is manufactured every year, of which between 5 and 13 million tons ends up in the oceans.\nOne study found that about 269,000 tons of plastic remains on the surfaces of the oceans.\nMuch of that is in the form of large plastic items, but 35,500 tons is microplastics.\nThis estimate does not include the microplastic waste that may have sunk into the depths of the oceans, washed ashore onto beaches, or been swallowed by marine animals.\nAnother study showed that vast quantities of microplastics are present on the deep sea floor, an amount about four times the amount seen on the surfaces of the oceans.\nAs plastic manufacturing is expected to rise to 1.1 billion tons by the year 2050, the amount of microplastics in the oceans will necessarily increase sharply.",
        "3": "《How does plastic pollution affect the seas and life on the earth?》\nMicroplastics in the oceans are a serious threat to the marine ecosystem.\nA group of French researchers reported that oysters exposed to microplastics produced fewer offspring and the offspring grew more slowly.\nAnother study has shown that microplastics are even preventing ocean fish from becoming adults.\nShockingly, some young fish have been found to prefer these tiny plastic particles to their natural food sources, starving themselves before they can reproduce.\nMoreover, microplastics in the seas absorb toxic industrial chemicals.\nA single microbead can be up to a million times more toxic than the water around it.\nThose chemicals move up the food chain, all the way to our dinner plate, when the toxic microplastics are eaten by fish and other marine organisms.\nIn fact, the toxic substances we consume at the top of the food chain can be harmful enough to cause genetic changes and cancer.",
        "4": "《What is being done about microplastic pollution?》\nScientists are investigating the microplastic problem at regional and international levels, and NGOs are leading many activities such as raising awareness, removing waste from seashores, and exploring the oceans.\nBased on scientific discoveries, NGOs are particularly demanding that products containing microplastics not be sold at all.\nAs a result, people, industries, and governments around the world are beginning to take notice of the microplastic problem.\nIn 2013, British ecologist Mark Browne launched a project to help reduce the number of microfibers released into the oceans.\nThis project aimed to create fabrics that release less plastic waste when washed.\nAlthough only one brand signed up for the project, Browne has had a lot of success with this company.\nNow, around 90 percent of the brand's clothing products are made with all natural fibers.\nSome governments have introduced legislation to deal with microplastics.\nIn 2015, the United States Congress approved a bill to ban the sale of products containing microbeads by 2018.\nThis policy, which was an important step towards tackling plastic pollution in the oceans, offers a model for the rest of the world.",
        "5": "《What we can do》\nAvoiding personal care products that have microbeads in them and clothing that was made from synthetic fibers would reduce the amount of microplastics entering marine and coastal environments.\nWhy, then, won't industries replace microplastics with natural substances?\nThe answer is simple: Companies want to keep microplastics in their products because they are cheap and easy to obtain.\nThe good news is that consumer demand is very powerful.\nFor example, if enough consumers realize the impact their clothing and skin care items have on the planet and their health and demand environmentally friendly products, the industry will have no choice but to provide them.\nTherefore, as a consumer, you should buy clothing made of natural materials like organic cotton and wool, and avoid synthetic ones as well as choose products that contain environmentally friendly alternatives over those that use microbeads.\nIsn't it great to know you can benefit the planet by making simple choices while you shop?",
        "6": "《The Trouble with E-Waste》\nEach day in Accra, the capital of Ghana, loads of old electronics are sold.\nIsrael Mensah, 20, and his friends buy a few of them and break them apart to remove valuable metals and wires.\nThen they burn the plastic coverings, emitting poisonous gases into the air.\nThe rest of the broken computer and monitor cases are thrown in a nearby lake.\nThe next day, the rain washes them into the ocean.\nAll the old electronic goods, including computers that we throw away, are called e-waste and it is being produced on a scale never seen before.\nThe bulk of all this waste is buried underground, where it poisons the environment by leaking toxic substances, such as lead.\nRecycling is the ideal solution to the problem, for e-waste contains significant amounts of valuable metals, such as silver and gold.\nThe problem is that a large percentage of the e-waste that could be recycled is dumped in developing countries like Ghana, which are paid by companies to use their land as dumping grounds.\nIt is less costly than recycling.\nThe hazards this e-waste causes to the health of the local people are often publicized, but international agreements to stop the shipping of e-waste have not been effective.\nUltimately, shipping e-waste overseas may come back to harm people in the developed world.\nJeffrey Weidenhamer, a chemistry professor at Ashland University in Ohio, U.S.A., bought some jewelry made in a developing country for his class to analyze.\nThe class was distressed, although not surprised, to learn that the jewelry contained high amounts of lead.",
        "7": "Jewelry containing lead has turned up before in U.S. stores, but in this case the lead was mixed with large quantities of other metals.\nWeidenhamer argued in a scientific paper that the proportions of these metals suggest that the jewelry was made from recycled computer parts.\nSince the developed world is sending vast quantities of materials containing lead to developing nations, it is to be expected that those countries will make use of those materials in their manufacturing processes.\n\"It's not at all surprising. Things are coming full circle.\nNow we're getting contaminated products back,\" says Weidenhamer.\nIn a global economy, it is no longer possible to get rid of something by sending it to other countries.\nAs the old saying goes, \"What goes around comes around.\""

        "3": "The cut-out process consisted of four steps.\nAfter purchasing raw materials — paper and gouache (a type of paint), studio assistants cut rectangular sheets of paper from large rolls and painted them with gouache.\nMatisse then cut shapes from these painted sheets, using a pair of scissors.\nAfter cutting the shapes, the next step was pinning the cut pieces of paper to the walls of his studio.\nHe directed his assistants to arrange and rearrange the pieces until he was completely satisfied with the results.\nWhen the desired balance of color and form was achieved, the finished composition was glued to paper, canvas, or board.\n《The Cut-Out Process》\nStep 1.

How lucky I was!\nMy disappointment suddenly turned into joy.\nI took great photos there and walked around the outside of the museum.\nThere were several unusual pieces of art installed there.\nThe most prominent one was the 9-meter-tall spider sculpture called Maman.\nThe spider, who is protecting her precious eggs, was like a creature out of a dream.\nIt was getting late, so I decided to return the next day.\nI wanted to see the art collections inside the museum, as well as the other artworks outside.",

        "2": "《Preserving Crop Diversity》\nFor thousands of years, people have grown and developed many varieties of food crops.\nHowever, the genetic diversity of our crops is declining.\nIn the past 100 years, 75 percent of the variety of crops has vanished in the U.S. alone.\nIn addition, global warming will definitely change future conditions for agriculture.\nSo adapting agriculture to these conditions will be essential.\nOn top of this, the practice of planting only one crop can also pose problems.\nWhy? Because a single seed type can turn out to be unsuitable for future climatic conditions or lack resistance to insects and crop diseases.\nA good example of the danger of using a single crop is the Irish potato famine of the 1840s.\nIn the 16th century, potatoes were brought from South America to the country of Ireland.\nBy the early 19th century, the potato had become Ireland's main crop.\nThe problem was that the farmers grew only one particular kind of potato.\nThis caused a terrible crisis.\nIn 1845, a disease spread among the potato crops in Ireland.\nNearly all of them died. There were no potatoes left to eat, and as a result, one million people died from lack of food.\nAnother million had to leave Ireland to survive.\nThis was a terrible tragedy.\nBut in retrospect, it did not have to happen.\nIf farmers had grown different varieties of potatoes, some of the crops might have resisted the disease.\nThese potatoes could have saved many lives.",
        "3": "《The Fight for a Seed》\nSeeds may seem insignificant, but if they disappear, there will be a food crisis.\nBecause of this, many countries have created seed banks to store seeds of different crop varieties.\nThere are some 1,700 seed banks in the world, but many of them are exposed to natural disasters, diseases, wars, and other risks.\nFor example, the national seed bank of the Philippines was damaged by flooding and later destroyed by a fire.\nThe seed banks of Afghanistan and Iraq were destroyed or severely damaged during recent wars.\nSo we can see that seed samples need to be stored in a very secure place.\nThis realization sparked the idea of building a global seed bank to serve as a backup storage facility.\nTherefore, in 2008, the Norwegian government and the Crop Trust worked together to establish the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.\nThis seed bank would contain backups of all the world's seeds.\nSmaller seed banks around the world would still collect and keep local seeds, but they would also send copies of their seeds to the global bank.",

        "5": "From the main entrance, a steel tunnel leads to three storage vaults.\nThe tunnel to the vaults is 100 meters long, and beyond it is the frozen storage area, where packages of seeds are kept at a temperature of –18℃.\nThe packages are placed inside boxes and stored on shelves inside the vault.\nThe low temperature and moisture levels inside the vault freeze the seeds and help them to last for long periods of time.\n572,425 crop varieties had been deposited into the Vault by 2015.\nBut in the same year, for the first time in its history, the Vault opened its doors to withdraw seeds.\nSyria's civil war created the need for this \"early withdrawal\" of seed samples deposited a few years earlier.\nThese were sent to the seed banks in Lebanon and Morocco to regenerate ancient food crops that had been lost during Syria's civil war.\nThis would not have been possible without the Vault.\nThe Vault is the ultimate insurance for the world's food supply, allowing future generations to overcome the challenges of climate change and other disasters.\nBy conserving crop seeds, the Vault will help us to ensure our food security, adapt to climate change, and maintain crop diversity.\nThis is not just a fight for the preservation of seeds.\nIt is a fight for humanity.",

Fish? Beef?\nNo, the final ingredient in this recipe is a type of insect: crickets!\nI'm sure that insects sound like a very surprising or even shocking ingredient to many of you.\nBut experts say that food shortage will be the most critical global issue by 2050 and that one possible solution to the problem is to consume insects.\nThis is because insects are good for the environment, public health, and also the economy. What do you say?\nDo you think insects will become the world's main source of protein in the future?\nWould you eat them?\nMaybe soon I will be asking my students, \"What insects did you have for breakfast today?\""

        "5": "《Smiling Connects Us》\nWhy do we smile?\nMost people will give an automatic answer: we smile because we feel happy.\nThat answer is right, but there is more to the story than that.\nIt turns out smiling is not just a result of happiness.\nIt is related to how healthy we are.\nSmiling reduces stress and lowers blood pressure, contributing to our physical well-being.\nIt also increases the amount of feel-good hormones in the same way that good exercise does.\nAccording to William Fry, a prominent pioneer in laughter research, one minute of smiling is equal to ten minutes of physical exercise on a rowing machine.\nAnd most of all, smiling reflects and influences how we relate to other people.\nSocial scientists have studied smiles and discovered important facts about them.\nProfessor Marianne LaFrance, for instance, says that smiles have multiple functions that we perform naturally because we are social beings.\nFrom the time we are babies, we smile to make and maintain our social relationships.\nWe use smiles to make new friends because people are naturally attracted to those who smile.\nWe also smile when we face difficult or embarrassing social situations.\nIn such circumstances, a smile can reduce conflict and embarrassment by conveying the message, \"I hope you can forgive me.\"\nAs people say, \"Smile, and the whole world smiles with you.\"",
        "6": "Smiling is clearly good for us and for our relationships.\nWe can even get some of the benefits of smiling just by making ourselves smile.\nHaving a difficult day? Try smiling at the people that you meet.\nFeeling low? Try making others smile.\nSeeing them smile will make you smile too because smiling is contagious.\nEven when we are alone, it can make us feel more connected and part of a community.\nSmiling faces on social media can cheer us up, helping us remember that we are related to others.\nSo smiling is more than just a way to say, \"I'm happy.\"\nIt is our way to connect to the world."

        "1": "《A Man of Creative Mind》\nHow much do you know about Leonardo da Vinci?\nTake the quiz and find out.\n① He was born in an Italian city called Vinci.\n② He became a professional painter at the age of 20.\n③ He produced several portraits, but the Mona Lisa is the only one that survives today.\n④ He pursued realism in his paintings based on his scientific knowledge.\n⑤ He sometimes took notes of his observations in left-handed mirror script.\n⑥ He was not only an artist but also a scientist and an engineer.\n⑦ He designed early models of the bicycle, the airplane, and the parachute.\nHow many T's and F's did you circle?\nIn fact, every single statement about the great man is true.\nWhere do you think da Vinci's greatness came from?",
        "2": "Leonardo da Vinci was born in Vinci, Italy, on April 15, 1452.\nHe did not receive any formal education, but his father realized da Vinci's talent in painting.\nSo, da Vinci was apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio, a famous sculptor and painter in Florence, at the age of 15.\nHe became a professional painter himself about five years later.\nDa Vinci was different from artists before him.\nHe wanted to create paintings that were as realistic as possible.\nIn the Mona Lisa, his only surviving portrait, you can see the lips that smile and the eyes that shine.\nThe striking realism is a result of his scientific knowledge of the human anatomy, perspective, and optics.\nBased on the human anatomy, he could produce a portrait that accurately reflects the proportions of different parts of the body.\nThanks to his knowledge of perspective, the woman's head and eyes are turned a little more toward the viewer.\nHe was also aware of the way light falls on curved surfaces, so the woman does not appear to be painted at all.\nAs a result of this convergence of art and science, he was able to create some of the most powerful and enduring works of art in history.",
        "3": "How could da Vinci be so creative and ingenious?\nOne of his sources was his great ability to observe.\nDa Vinci stressed the importance of observation.\nHe always carried a pen and a notebook with him to write down what he saw.\nThousands of surviving pages of his notebooks reveal how he worked.\nHe wrote and drew on many subjects including anatomy, flight, gravity, and optics, sometimes writing in left-handed mirror script.\nThis way, he was able to come up with brilliant ideas that ultimately led to the inventions of the bicycle, airplane, submarine, and parachute centuries later.\nWhen da Vinci observed something which intrigued him, he asked one question after another.\nAfter observing birds and bats, for instance, he asked himself, \"How do birds and bats fly?\"\nBy answering this question, he hoped to find the secret to how people, too, could fly.\nHe was very curious about the mechanics of flight and designed several flying machines.\nHe sketched machines where the pilot would lie down or stand and then use his or her legs or arms to make the machines go.\nThese machines were very imaginative.\nHowever, da Vinci got stuck on one point:\nhumans have limited muscle power and endurance compared to birds and bats.\nStill, he did not give up but kept experimenting endlessly with new ideas.\nThough the flying machines were not successful, his efforts provided much useful information for the future inventors of airplanes.",
        "4": "Out of curiosity, da Vinci explored different fields throughout his lifetime.\nThanks to his extensive knowledge, he was able to take a single idea and make it branch out and flourish in different directions.\nAdditionally, he was in a position to make connections between disparate things.\nHe eagerly pursued the possibility that seemingly unrelated things could be combined to make something completely new.\nFor most people, emotional and subjective art does not mix well with science, which stresses logic and reason.\nHowever, da Vinci combined the two with grace and beauty.\nDa Vinci showed us what a truly creative mind, combined with dedicated and persistent effort, can really do.\nAs a forward-thinking pioneer, he is a good example of the creativity and innovation that has great importance in today's world.\nNo wonder people call Leonardo da Vinci \"a man of creative mind.\"",
        "5": "《Creativity TO THE RESCUE》\nSometimes creative thinking can turn life upside down.\nIt can turn something we do not want to do at all into something we look forward to doing.\nIt can turn a boring routine into an exciting game.\nDoesn't that sound like fun?\nAre you anxious to finish in time or get good grades when you do your assignments?\nWhat if you did the assignments just because you wanted to?\nWhat would it take for you to get to that level of motivation?\nThat is the type of questions some researchers asked themselves.\nThey wanted to test their idea that \"something as simple as having fun is the easiest way to change people's behavior for the better.\"\nTo test their idea, the researchers started with a few interesting projects.\nFor instance, they asked, \"Can we get more people to choose the stairs by making it fun to do so?\"\nThen they transformed the stairs at a subway station into \"Piano Stairs,\" which made beautiful sounds when people stepped on them.\nThe result was that 66% more people than usual chose the stairs over the escalators.\nThen they focused on trash and asked, \"Can we get more people to throw their trash in trash bins by making it fun to do so?\"\nBy adding a sound effect to a bin, they made the experience fun.\nAs a result, people deposited 230% more trash in the \"World's Deepest Trash Bin\" than in a regular one nearby.\nThere were no threats or penalties.\nThe researchers proved that fun is a great motivator in situations where nothing else seems to work.",
        "6": "Fun Theory has been tried by ordinary people as well.\nFor example, someone in the U.S. wondered if he could make obeying the speed limit more fun.\nSo, he came up with a game-like system where people earned points for staying under the limit.\nIt recorded people who obeyed the law with a camera and then automatically gave them a free lottery ticket when they earned enough points.\nThat simple idea ― providing a reward for doing the right thing ― resulted in a big decrease in the average speed.\nDo these examples expand your sense of the power of fun?\nThen let us go back to our original question, \"What would it take for you to be motivated, not forced, to do your school assignments?\"\nThink about it creatively and then add some fun to your day!"

Study, not games.\"",
        "2": "Mom the rapper is an interesting idea.\nHowever, she would not make it as an actual rapper.\nRap music is much more complex than just thump, thump, thump in a simple, boring pattern.\nIn rap music, it is a creative combination of exciting rhythms and powerful words that grabs the listener's attention.\nRhythm is a regular, repeated pattern of sounds.\nAs music moves forward in time, your brain listens to the length of individual sounds and groups them together into bunches that let you perceive a pattern.\nThis pattern could be the irresistible rhythm of a rap song.\nOr it could be the beginning of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony: \"Bum, bum, bum, bummm. Bum, bum, bum, bummm.\"\nA good rapper creates rhythms that are clearly distinct from those of other genres of music and exciting enough to make you move.\nOne way to create rap's rhythm is by sampling, which is taking a little bit of music from another source.\nThe artist samples a piece of another song of his or her own composition, someone else's popular song, or even a classical work.\nHe or she repeats it again and again, creating a loop.\nThe new lyrics are then performed over that background.\nOne of rap's best known artists, Nas, shows an excellent example of this.\nIn his famous song, \"I Can,\" he samples a classical composition, \"Für Elise\" by Beethoven.",
        "3": "It takes a lot of practice to rap well because exciting rhythms should be creatively and effectively combined with strong language.\nRappers tell a story in their lyrics using language rhythmically.\nThat is, they rely on intricately constructed rhymes and say powerful words with exciting rhythms.\nThis way of delivery sets rap apart from talking.\nIn rap, you are not just talking.\nYou are expressing yourself poetically with animating rhythms in the background.\nAn effective rap artist often plays with and changes the way words and phrases are normally said in order to make them fit the flow of the music.\nFor instance, the word \"California\" could be pronounced \"Californ-eye-ay.\"\nThis is an unexpected change and, if it suits the situation, a delightful one.\nA rap song, like those of other genres, is based on a beat, the basic unit of time in music.\nA rap artist usually plays cycles of \"ONE, two, three, four\" which make it possible for you to tap your foot or clap in time with the song.\nRap and other popular music forms often spell out the beats explicitly with drums.\nWhether rappers simply recite lyrics or create them spontaneously, they have to keep up with the beats.",
        "4": "Finally, for music to move, it is important to observe a tempo.\nIf rap is delivered very slowly, it can sound like a funeral march.\nIn contrast, if it goes too fast, the listener cannot catch the different words.\nOne of the rap artist's tasks is to choose a tempo that moves the music forward in an exciting way, not too fast and not too slowly.\nEnjoying music is not about analyzing these details, however.\nIf someone asks, \"Why do you like rap?\" a likely answer would be, \"Because it's cool.\"\nRap is enjoyable because it delights the listener with a creative mix of musical elements that satisfies and sometimes goes against his or her expectations.\nA good rapper might stop in the middle of a line, pause, and deliver the words in an unexpected way, creating a fresh, new feeling.\nRap may be based on an ancient tradition of rhyming and rhythm, but it succeeds because it is COOL.",
        "5": "《Pythagoras: The Father of MUSIC》\nEverybody knows that Pythagoras is an ancient Greek mathematician.\nBut did you know that he also played a big role in music?\nPythagoras loved music and was skilled at playing the lyre, an ancient string instrument.\nHe always believed that everything in the world was ruled by numbers.\nTo him, music was no exception.\nIn fact, he was the first person to find the surprising connection between music and math.\nOne day Pythagoras was walking past a blacksmith's shop when he noticed something very interesting.\nWhenever the blacksmiths struck the anvil with hammers, different notes were produced.\nAlso, combinations of these notes sounded harmonious in some instances and not so harmonious at other times.\nPythagoras wanted to find out why mathematically.\nFirst, he tried to find the relationship between different notes and objects creating sound vibrations.\nHe carried out many experiments.\nHe used different objects, like strings, bells, and water-filled cups.\nIn his experiments with strings, he found that the shorter a string is, the higher the note that is created.\nHe also found that a ratio of 2:1 produced the same note at two different pitches.\nFor example, a 50-centimeter string produced a lower DO, and a 25-centimeter one produced a higher DO.\nPythagoras further varied the length of his strings.\nBy doing so, he finally identified the ratios for six more notes between DO at a lower pitch and DO at a higher pitch.\nThus, all the notes on the musical scale could be mathematically expressed.\nThis series of eight notes in a musical scale is now called an \"octave.\"",
        "6": "Then, why were some combinations of notes more harmonious than others?\nTo find out, Pythagoras used his favored strings again.\nHe found that the most pleasing harmony occurred when the length ratio of two strings was 3:2 (DO and SOL).\nThis harmony is called \"a perfect fifth\" in modern music.\nThe perfect fifth is used in tuning musical instruments today.\nUltimately, Pythagoras put his principles of harmony to practical use, employing them to cure diseases of the body and mind.\nNo wonder Pythagoras is often called the father of music.\nNext time you listen to your favorite music, perhaps you should thank him."

        "1": "《Language: A Culture Capsule》\nIn Romeo and Juliet, a tragedy by William Shakespeare, Juliet says, \"What's in a name?\nThat which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\"\nThe flower is called kufufuka, whakatika, mawar, and ruusu, in Swahili, Maori, Indonesian, and Finnish, respectively.\nIt is indeed true that a rose would remain beautiful and keep its sweet scent even if it were called something else.\nThis means that a name in a language is often arbitrary.\nHowever, there are examples which show that there is something in a name.\nConsider the term \"smoking gun,\" for instance, which was first used in the Sherlock Holmes story, \"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott,\" in 1893.\nEverybody knows that a gun does not smoke a cigarette or a cigar.\nIn English, \"a smoking gun\" refers to an object or a fact that serves as conclusive evidence for a crime or a similar act.\nIf a person were found with a smoking gun in his or her hand, the person would be considered the one who fired the shot.\nThe frequent use of the term reflects an old culture where people used to carry guns in their daily lives.",
        "2": "\"To cross the Rubicon\" is another example in English.\nThe phrase, which means \"to reach a point where you cannot change a decision,\" originates with Julius Caesar.\nHis victories abroad made him a hero to the Romans.\nHowever, the senators did not like him, and they conspired to make people think that Caesar was a traitor.\nCaesar knew that crossing the Rubicon River with his army was against the law, and that he would suffer death if he did so alone.\nHe stood at the river for a long time.\nConvinced that the Romans still thought of him as a hero, Caesar led his army across the Rubicon, the point of no return.\nThis ancient history is being kept in the English phrase.\nContemporary culture is also reflected in language.\nOne British publisher releases a list of new informal expressions that are added to their dictionary every year.\nIn 2015, one of the new expressions was \"mic drop,\" which literally refers to an act of deliberately dropping or tossing aside one's microphone at the end of a particularly impressive performance or speech.\nThe mic drop has been employed by rappers and comedians since at least the 1980s, and it has grown steadily in popularity over recent years.\nThe expression is mostly used figuratively as in, \"He entertained the audience with his acceptance speech and mic drop after winning the award.\"",
        "3": "It is clear by now that language, especially its non-arbitrary aspect, reflects culture and history.\nThis applies not just to Western languages but also to Asian languages like Korean.\nYou will know what sichimi tteda means.\nIn fact, tteda is a common word which means \"to remove\" in Korean.\nHowever, have you ever wondered what sichimi means?\nThe term comes from traditional Korean falconry, an old way to hunt with a falcon.\nIn the old days, a tag called sichimi was placed on a falcon's tail to show who owned the bird.\nThieves would steal falcons and replace the tags with their own, pretending that the birds belonged to them.\nAnother Korean tradition is Korean wrestling called ssireum.\nIn its modern form, each of the two contestants wears a belt (satba) around the waist and the thigh.\nThey lock on to each other's belts, and one achieves victory by bringing any part of the opponent's body above the knee to the ground.\nEach contestant employs a series of tactics, which cause little or no injury to the opponent.\nTtanjuk is one tactic by means of which a contestant uses his foot to bring the opponent down.\nIn today's Korean, the expression ttanjuk geolda means that you try to keep someone else from achieving the previously agreed-upon goal by doing or saying something irrelevant.",
        "4": "Sometimes it is unclear where an expression originated.\nHowever, there are interesting and convincing stories about where it might have come from.\nFor example, Koreans often say eocheogunieopda to express that they are greatly perplexed.\nIn this expression, eopda means \"without\" in Korean, but what does eocheoguni mean?\nAccording to folk etymology, eocheoguni refers to the handle on a hand mill traditionally used for grinding food items.\nSuppose that someone wants to grind beans using a hand mill.\nIf the handle were missing, they would most likely feel perplexed.\nThe examples above clearly demonstrate that language reflects our culture and history.\nNow, look for additional examples and think about what they mean and how they relate to culture and history.\nYou will be able to see for yourself that Juliet was only partly right.",
        "5": "《The Gifts of Rome》\nThe ancient city of Rome was destroyed; the Roman Empire has disappeared.\nHowever, the Romans gave us inventions, ideas, and words that we use every single day.\nYou may not realize that you use them on a daily basis, but you are using one of them right now!\nThe Romans were the first people to use books with pages.\nThey figured out how to sew pages together along one side so that you can turn the pages and read both the front and back of each one.\nBefore the Romans, people used scrolls — long pieces of paper or animal skin — that they had to unroll to read and roll back up when they were finished.\nIf there were no books today, what would you be reading in bed or on the bus?\nEvery time you read a book, you are using a Roman invention.\nIf you look at coins in many countries, you will see that a coin usually has a picture of a head on it.\nThe Romans began the custom of putting pictures of great leaders on coins.\nToday, we put pictures of our leaders on coins, copying the Romans.\nFor instance, the 100 won coin shows a portrait of Admiral Yi Sunsin, while the U.S. penny shows that of Abraham Lincoln.\nMany words you see daily came from the Romans, too.\nMost of the twelve months on your calendar have Roman names.\nJanuary is named after the Roman god Janus, and July is named after the Roman general Julius Caesar.\nThe names of the planets also originated from the Romans.\nJupiter is the king of the gods, while Venus is named after the goddess of love and beauty.",
        "6": "The English language borrowed many words from Latin, the language of the Romans.\nThe frigidarium was the room where the Romans had a bath in very cold water.\nWhat sounds like frigidarium and keeps things cold? The refrigerator!\nThe English word for a place where books are kept comes from the Latin word for book liber.\nHave you ever written \"P.S.\" at the end of a letter?\nIf so, you have used Latin words.\n\"P.S.\" stands for the Latin words post scriptum, which means \"after the writing.\"\nIf we lacked the handy \"P.S.,\" we would have to use more words to signal that we have an additional message.\nThe Roman Empire is gone, but Rome will never completely disappear.\nThe gifts that the Romans gave to us are still with us today."

        "1": "《Can I Swim?》\nTom Michell is a British teacher.\nIn the 1970s, he worked at an English language boarding school in Argentina.\nOne day he visited a beach and found a penguin that was injured and alone.\nMichell decided to help the bird.\nHe cleaned it, fed it, and even gave it a name — Juan Salvado.\nFrom that day on, Juan Salvado lived on the terrace of his room in the school dormitory.\nThe following is part of the story, written by Tom Michell, about the penguin and a boy at the school.\nFrom the first day that I brought a penguin to live at the school, one student in particular wanted to help with his care.\nHis name was Diego Gonzales.\nDiego was a shy boy who seemed to be frightened of his own shadow.\nHe struggled with his classes, and none of the after-school activities seemed to suit him.\nHe was neither strong nor athletic.\nOn the rugby field, nobody passed the ball to him or involved him in the game, except to make fun of him.",
        "2": "Diego's early education had not prepared him well for life at his new school.\nHis knowledge of English was limited, so he avoided conversation.\nHowever, Diego enjoyed the company of Juan Salvado.\nIndeed, on the terrace, Diego could relax.\nHe had some friends who also had trouble fitting in.\nLooking after Juan Salvado was good for those boys.\nThey fed him fish, swept the terrace, and spent time with him.\nOne day, I took Juan Salvado to the school swimming pool with the boys.\nAs soon as the other swimmers left, we brought Juan Salvado to the water to see if he would swim.\nJuan Salvado had been living at the school for several months by then.\nHowever, in all that time, he had never been able to swim because his feathers had been damaged.",
        "3": "\"Go on!\" I said.\nThe penguin stared at me and then at the pool, like he was asking, \"Ah!\nIs this where the fish come from?\"\nWithout further encouragement, he jumped in.\nWith a single movement of his wings, he flew like an arrow across the water and knocked into the wall on the opposite side.\nLuckily, he was not hurt!\nI had never had the opportunity to study a penguin in the water before.\nI was familiar with the awkward way that Juan Salvado walked on land, but now I watched in awe.\nUsing only a stroke or two, he flew at great speed from one end of the pool to the other, turning swiftly before touching the sides.\nIt was amazing!\nEveryone could see how much he was enjoying himself.\n\"Ooh! Aah!\"\nThe boys shouted, as though they were watching a fireworks display.\nAfter a while, Diego came over and asked quietly, \"Can I swim, too?\"",
        "4": "I was astonished.\nHe had never gone near the pool before.\nI was not even sure if he could swim.\n\"The water is cold, and it's getting late.\nAre you sure you want to go in?\" I asked.\n\"Please!\"\n\"All right then,\"\nI said, \"but be quick!\"\nI had never seen him so excited before.\nHis eyes were shining with joy, and he seemed to be truly alive for the first time.\nWithout hesitating, he dived into the cold water.\nI was ready to jump in and rescue him if he could not swim.\nHowever, I soon realized that I did not have anything to worry about.\nNot only could Diego swim, but he swam magnificently!\nHe chased after Juan Salvado, and they swam in perfect harmony.\nIt was like a duet written for violin and piano.\nSometimes Juan Salvado took the lead and Diego followed after him.\nAt other times Diego went ahead and the penguin swam around the boy.\nOccasionally they swam so close that they almost touched.",
        "5": "I was almost speechless.\nSuddenly Diego was not the sad little boy we had become used to.\nHe was a very normal boy with a very special talent.\n\"Diego! You can swim!\"\n\"Yes, I can swim.\"\n\"I mean you are able to swim really well.\nBrilliantly, in fact!\"\n\"Do you think so?\"\nHe asked without looking directly at me, but I saw a smile on his face.\nAs we returned to the dormitory, Diego told me that his father had taught him how to swim in the river by their home.\nIt was the first time he had talked about his life.\nI listened in silence, without making any corrections to his English, as he talked nonstop all the way back to the dormitory.",
        "6": "The events of that day were extraordinary.\nA child had gone down to the water to swim with a penguin, and shortly afterward, a young man had emerged.\nThe ugly duckling had become a swan.\nIt was definitely a turning point.\nDiego's confidence grew quickly after that day.\nWhen the school had a swimming competition, he won every race he participated in.\nThe encouragement and acknowledgement given by the other boys was genuine.\nHe had earned the respect of his classmates.\nOver the next few weeks, his grades improved and he became more popular.\nThanks to a swim with a penguin, a lonely boy's life was changed forever."

        "3": "Parks's calm response to the situation impressed many people.\nSoon after, her quiet resistance came together with the inspirational speechmaking of Martin Luther King Jr.\nWhen 5,000 people assembled at a rally to support Parks's act of courage, King made a speech to the crowd.\nHe was an extrovert — assertive, sociable, and good at motivating people.\n\"There comes a time when people get tired of being trampled,\" he told them.\n\"There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the sunlight.\" King was an amazing speaker, and his words filled the people with pride and hope.\nHe then praised Parks's bravery and hugged her.\nShe stood silently.\nHer mere presence was enough to strengthen the crowd.",

        "2": "At one time, tigers were found all across Asia, from Korea to Turkey.\nHowever, the world's tiger population has been shrinking rapidly.\nIllegal hunting and habitat loss are the main reasons behind this decrease.\nAt the start of the 20th century, it was estimated that there were approximately 100,000 wild tigers.\nIn recent years, however, three of the nine subspecies of tigers have become extinct.\nIn fact, it is now estimated that there are fewer than 4,000 tigers living in the wild.\nSome experts even predict that the last of the world's wild tigers will disappear within the next 10 years.",

        "5": "《Small Efforts with Big Results》\nNow, it is obvious that we must protect tigers.\nYou may, however, still wonder how switching off the lights helps.\nWell, the lights in our homes require electricity, and more than half of the world's electricity is created by burning fossil fuels.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide is released into the air, and this contributes to climate change.\nClimate change has a number of negative effects, including rising sea levels that threaten many parts of the world.\nOne of these places, called the Sundarbans, is an area on the coast of Bangladesh inhabited by a large number of tigers.\nIf Earth's oceans continue to rise, this area could be wiped out and its tiger population could be reduced by as much as 96%.\nBy conserving energy, however, we can slow climate change, and this will slow the rise of the oceans.\nSo keep switching off the lights whenever you're the last person to leave a room!",

        "2": "As soon as I walked in, I could not help but admire some ink-and-water paintings by Jeong Seon, a famous Korean artist also known as Gyeomjae.\nThese paintings were kept in an album called the *Haeak jeonsincheop.\nThey depict the beautiful scenery of Geumgangsan Mountain and its surrounding areas.\nThe way Gyeomjae painted the mountains, rivers, and valleys makes them look very inviting.\nI was shocked when the museum tour guide said that the album was almost burned as kindling.\nFortunately, it was rescued at the last minute and later purchased by Kansong.\nKnowing that these beautiful paintings were nearly turned to ashes made me feel very sad.\nI am thankful that these paintings are still around so that future generations can also appreciate them.",
        "3": "The next item that impressed me was a gorgeous porcelain vase called the *Celadon Prunus Vase with Inlaid Cloud and Crane Design.\nIt is a pleasant shade of green, with a lovely pattern of clouds and cranes encircling the entire vase.\nThe cranes seem to be alive and stretching their wings in search of freedom.\nKansong bought the vase from a Japanese art dealer in 1935.\nWith the money he spent on it, Kansong could have bought 20 nice houses!\nLater, a different Japanese collector offered double the price Kansong had paid for the vase.\nHowever, Kansong refused to part with it because he knew that it was the most magnificent vase of its kind.\nToday it is listed as one of Korea's National Treasures.\nSeeing it in person was an absolutely breathtaking experience!",
        "4": "Finally, I saw the one item in the museum that I will never forget — an original copy of the *Hunminjeongeum Haerye.\nThis ancient book was written in 1446, and it explains the ideas and principles behind the creation of Hangeul, the writing system of the Korean language.\nIt was found in Andong in 1940.\nAt that time, however, Korea was still occupied by Japan.\nThe Japanese colonial government intended to get rid of the Korean language.\nSchools were forbidden to teach lessons in Korean, and scholars who studied Korean were arrested.",
        "5": "From the moment he heard that the Hunminjeongeum Haerye had been discovered, Kansong couldn't stop thinking about it.\nHe knew he had to protect it at all costs.\nAfter years of waiting, he was finally able to obtain the book.\nHe purchased it at ten times the price the owner was asking and carefully hid it in his house.\nWhen the Japanese were finally defeated, he was able to share it with the rest of Korea.\nThe guide said that the Hunminjeongeum Haerye is the museum's most precious treasure.\nWithout it, the origins and fundamentals of Hangeul would have been lost to history.\nIt has since been designated a National Treasure of Korea and included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\nLooking at the ancient book, I could feel Kansong's strong commitment to preserving Korean history.",
        "6": "Standing in the middle of the exhibition hall, surrounded by Korean art, I could not stop thinking about Kansong.\nHe was an amazing person!\nHe did not collect art for his personal enjoyment.\nHe did it to protect Korea's cultural identity during the harsh Japanese colonial period.\nAfter Korea regained its independence, he stopped collecting art, as he knew it would safely remain in Korea.\nDuring our country's worst time, a single man was able to defend Korea's national spirit and pride.\nThanks to him, we are still able to experience an essential part of Korean culture today.\nFounded in 1938, the Kansong Art Museum was Korea's first private museum.\nWhen Kansong built it, he named it Bohwagak.\nHe used the building as a place to store all of the important cultural items he had collected over the years.\nKansong died in 1962, and Bohwagak was renamed the Kansong Art Museum in 1966.\nIt now holds about 5,000 items, including 12 Korean National Treasures."

        "2": "《The Curving Beauty of Nature》\nThe Sagrada Familia is an enormous church in Barcelona, Spain.\nDesigned by the world-famous architect Antoni Gaudi, the church is one of the most prominent buildings in the world.\nConstruction of this remarkable building began in 1882, and Gaudi took over responsibility for its design in 1883.\nBelieve it or not, the building is still under construction.\nSome people love the Sagrada Familia and others hate it, but nearly everyone is fascinated by its unique design.\nGaudi believed that all architects should look to nature for inspiration.\nHe preferred the curves found in natural objects to the straight lines found in artificial ones.\nThis preference can be seen in all his buildings, including the Sagrada Familia.\nMany parts of the church incorporate images and forms from nature.\nFor example, the church's spires are topped with spheres that resemble fruits.\nThere are also turtles carved into the stone bases of columns and spiral stairs that resemble the shells of sea creatures.",
        "3": "Perhaps the most impressive feature of the Sagrada Familia is the ceiling.\nGaudi designed the columns inside the church to resemble trees and branches, so visitors who look up can feel as if they were standing in a great forest.\nThe light that comes through the small holes all over the ceiling even resembles the light beaming through leaves in a forest.\nThese tree-like columns are not just for decoration, though.\nInspired by trees, Gaudi gave the columns a single base that splits off into branches near the top.\nThis allows them to support the roof better by distributing its weight evenly.\nBecause Gaudi recognized the superiority of natural forms, he was able to design a building that is both beautiful and functional.",
        "4": "《A Lesson from Insects》\nThe Eastgate Centre is an office building and shopping complex in Harare, Zimbabwe.\nBuilt in 1996, it might not be as visually impressive as the Sagrada Familia.\nHowever, the building is an excellent example of biomimicry.\nDue to the hot climate of Harare, air conditioning systems can be very costly to install, run, and maintain.\nTo solve this problem, the building's architect, Mick Pearce, turned to *termite mounds for an alternative.\nTermite mounds are large structures built by certain termite species.\nScientists believe that the mounds stay cool due to a constant flow of air.\nEach mound has a network of holes referred to as chimneys.\nIt has a large central chimney and smaller outer chimneys that are close to the ground.\nThe heat generated by the daily activity of the termites rises up through the central chimney, eventually escaping through the top of the mound.\nIn the meantime, cooler air is pulled in through the smaller chimneys, keeping the termites' home at a comfortable temperature during the hot day.",
        "5": "Also, the soil surrounding the mound absorbs heat in the hot daytime hours.\nTherefore, the temperature inside the mound does not increase greatly and stays relatively cool.\nAt night, when the outside temperature goes down, the heat is finally released.\nThis process inspired Pearce to design an innovative climate control system.\nThe Eastgate Centre was constructed without a conventional cooling system.\nInstead, Pearce used building materials that can store large amounts of heat.\nThe floors and walls of the building absorb heat during the day, just like the soil of a termite mound.\nThe heat is released at night, and the walls cool down, ready to store heat again by the next morning.\nThe structure of the building also helps keep the building cool.\nThere are openings near the base of the building, and outside air comes into the building through them.\nThis air is moved through the building by a system of automatic fans.\nEventually, the air, along with heat generated by human activity during the day, rises upward through the building's internal open spaces and is released through chimneys on the roof.",
        "6": "As a result, the building has not only cool temperatures but also fresh air.\nMore importantly, the Eastgate Centre uses far less energy than other buildings, which saves money and helps protect the environment from pollution.\nWithout the inspiration Pearce received from tiny termites, none of this would have been possible.\nUsing biomimicry in architecture is just one way that humans are utilizing the lessons of nature to improve the way we do things.\nBiomimicry is also being used to solve problems in the fields of robotics, agriculture, and many others.\nImitating the ideas of nature not only helps solve problems, but it also makes us feel closer to nature.\nAs a result, humans are more likely to stop destroying the environment and start becoming part of it instead."

        "1": "《Help! I Am Stressed Out!》\nDear Teens Today,\nI keep having dreams about getting chased or taking a test where I don't know any answers.\nI often wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.\nOn some mornings, I feel so tired that I don't think I'll be able to lift my feet.\nWhat's wrong with me?\nHelp!\n– A worried teenager\nDear worried teenager,\nWe have good news and bad news for you.\nThe good news is that you don't sound like you are ill.\nThe bad news is that it is highly likely that you are stressed out.\nAlthough the word \"stress\" brings up images of tired adults, many teens also suffer from a high level of stress, often without even knowing that they do.\nAt least, now you know that you are under stress.\nIt is a big step forward because only you, no one else, can control your stress level, but to wisely manage your stress, you need to have a good understanding of the issue.\nTo help you with that, Teens Today had an informative talk on stress and its management with a doctor specializing in mental health.\nAs the saying goes, \"Know your enemy, and you will fight better!\"",
        "2": "《Q&A with the Doctor: Stress and Its Management》\n《Q: What is the first thing we should know about stress?》\nYou need to understand that stress is not a disease.\nIt is a normal reaction that almost everyone experiences.\nIn fact, stress is a natural alarm system in your brain and body, going back to the primitive days.\nThis involuntary response developed in our ancestors as a way to protect them from predators and other threats.\nImagine you meet a tiger in the jungle.\nYou have to fight it or run fast to save your life, so your body turns on its emergency system, releasing into the blood the hormones that speed up your heart rate, increase your blood pressure, boost your energy, and prepare you to deal with the problem.\nExperts call this the \"fight-or-flight response,\" and the human race could not have survived in its early, tough natural environment without it.",
        "3": "《Q: Then, is stress not bad?》\nNo. Not always.\nA little stress is essential to push you to get things done.\nIt prepares you to meet a tough situation with focus, strength, and alertness.\nWithout stress, you would not be able to gather enough energy to face difficulties, meet deadlines, and achieve successes.\n《Q: Why, then, does everybody think it's a big problem?》\nThe problem is, times have changed, but the stress reaction remains the same.\nStress hormones burn away when you get rid of the stress source.\nBack in the old days, it was a matter of either death or survival, and then the crisis came to an end.\nNow, however, many of your worries are not as instantly resolved as they were when you used to bump into tigers.\nYou might have an exam tomorrow and an assignment due the day after tomorrow.\nThe danger signs are almost always on, and the stress hormones stay in your body and build up.\nBlood rushes to your face.\nYour stomach stops working and feels upset or as if it is tied up in knots.\nYou feel restless in your legs and have difficulty going to sleep.\nNone of this helps you with doing your homework, and when it keeps happening, it can harm your health.",
        "4": "《Q: What do we need to do to deal with it?》\nWe all know that the best response is to fight and solve the problem, but it's not always easy to do so.\nIn that case, the hormones might make you want to run away, but running away from your problems is one of the worst ways to deal with stress.\nFor example, skipping school may feel good at the time, but it will drag you into even deeper trouble afterward.\nA better way to deal with stress is physical exercise, for what the stress hormones really tell you to do is to literally move your body and run.\nExercise burns away extra stress hormones and replaces them with others that make you happy.\nThen your body will be refreshed and ready to meet the next challenge.\nFinally, strike a balance between work and play.\nSchool is important, but it is not everything.\nWhen you plan your week, schedule time to get schoolwork done, but also schedule time to have fun.\nWhen it's time to enjoy yourself, try not to worry about school or homework.\nFocus on having fun.",
        "5": "《Q: Is there anything special about teenage stress, compared with that of adults?》\nI believe so because growing up is not easy.\nTeenage experiences vary, and everyone experiences different emotions and concerns.\nThe one thing that unites you all, however, is that you are changing, from being a youth to becoming an independent adult.\nDuring this time of transition you live with a lot of uncertainties and imbalances, which create huge anxieties.\nIt is important to know that it is natural for you to feel stressed, and that it is okay.\nJust keep in mind that whatever stresses you out now will eventually pass.\n《More Tips to Keep Stress under Control\n1. Avoid overscheduling.\nBe realistic and do not try to be perfect.\n2. Learn to relax.\nWhen you feel extreme stress, get quiet and take a few deep breaths.\nThis brings oxygen to your brain and helps you relax.\n3. Treat your body well.\nWatch what you eat.\nUnder stressful conditions, the body needs vitamins and minerals more than ever.\nA good night's sleep will relieve stress as well.\n4. Get help.\nStress can be overwhelming.\nDo not hesitate to ask for help from a trustworthy adult or a school counselor."

        "1": "《Chilies, Potatoes, and Tomatoes: The Globalization of Food》\nLook at your evening meal.\nYou might find rice, a bean paste stew with potatoes, a few dishes of vegetables, and of course Gimchi, which contains a lot of spicy chili.\nSince chilies, in particular, are an essential ingredient for many spicy Korean dishes, you would hardly suspect that they originated in another country.\nYou would not be the first person to make that mistake.\nAsk a Chinese or an Indian or a Mexican, and most will argue that chilies are native to their homeland.\nSorry for them, but they are all wrong.\nChili peppers originated in South America.\nNot just chili peppers, but many of the foods we consume today, including potatoes and tomatoes, originated in the same region and spread to the rest of the world because of the work of a single person.\nThis story is an interesting part in the history of the globalization of food.",
        "2": "In 1492, when Christopher Columbus, the Italian explorer, set sail from Spain to find a new route to India, the purpose of his journey was to find a way to safely bring black pepper from Asia and secure the kitchens of Europe.\nEuropeans had used black pepper as a medicine and a spice since ancient times.\nImported from South India and nearby islands, black pepper was an expensive spice.\nWhen the Ottoman Empire took over Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, it effectively blocked routes to India, and the price of black pepper shot up.\nAs a result, European traders had to look for new ways to trade with India for pepper and other spices.\nColumbus headed west and, upon reaching the islands of the Caribbean, believed he had found the route to India that he was seeking.\nHe was mistaken, of course.\nInstead of black pepper, he found other plants that he thought to be another type of pepper.\nThose plants were later called chilies or chili peppers.\nEuropeans at first hesitated to try chilies, just the way many people today do not like to try new foods.",
        "3": "When Portuguese traders carried chilies to other parts of the world, however, including Africa and Southeast Asia, it revolutionized local kitchens.\nPeople loved chilies so much that they put them into every dish possible.\nThe speed of the chili pepper's spread was exceptional.\nWithin a half century after arriving in Spain, it was being used across much of Asia, along the coast of Africa, in the Middle East, and in Eastern Europe.\nChilies spread quickly, in part because they were easy to grow in a wide range of climates and conditions, which made them an abundant crop.\nFrom a nutritional point of view, chilies are much less valuable than rice, corn, or potatoes.\nBy making even plain food rich in flavor, however, chilies were the one luxury item the poor could afford to eat every day.\nMany local dishes, popular among common people, were transformed into hot, spicy, and unique foods, thanks to chilies.\nCurry in India, hot pot in South China, tom yum in Thailand, and goulash in Hungary are just a few of the foods that were reborn with chilies.",
        "4": "When returning to Spain, Columbus took other new crops that he expected would capture the attention of Europeans.\nThey included potatoes and tomatoes.\nWhile chilies improved ordinary food by adding spice to them, potatoes greatly improved the nutrition of the populations of Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nPotatoes were at first less favored than sweet potatoes by Europeans.\nAfter it was revealed that potatoes were not only nutritious but also grew well on poor soils and in hostile climates, their cultivation quickly spread to Northern and Eastern Europe.\nIn Ireland, for example, the potato became the staple food, with adults consuming an average of ten potatoes a day.\nAccording to one estimate, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the population growth in Europe, Africa, and Asia between 1700 and 1900.\nAmong the crops that Columbus introduced to Europe, tomatoes had to wait longer than the others, nearly two hundred years, before becoming part of everyday meals.\nThere were two reasons for this.\nThe first was that the tomato looked a lot like the fruit of certain poisonous plants that were well known to Europeans.\nBecause of this, they were at first grown only as a decorative plant rather than as a food.\nSeveral decades passed before they began to be consumed as a food, and then, during the 1500s, they spread slowly to Spain, Italy, and France.",
        "5": "Up until the late 1700s, however, a large percentage of Europeans still feared the tomato.\nAnother name for the fruit was \"poison apple\" because it was thought that the nobles got sick and sometimes died after eating them.\nThat was the second reason that tomatoes were slow to spread as a food.\nThe truth was that wealthy Europeans at that time ate off plates made of heavy metals including considerable amounts of lead.\nBecause tomatoes are high in acidity, when placed on such plates, the fruit would release the lead, resulting in the poisoning of the diner.\nNo one at the time made the connection between the plate and the poison, so the tomato was blamed.\nThe tomato was later cleared of its false charge, and the invention of pizza in Naples in the 1880s kicked off the tomato's popularity in Europe.\nFor thousands of years chilies, potatoes, and tomatoes had been consumed only in certain regions in South America before they crossed the Atlantic Ocean five hundred years ago.\nThey spread to other continents and, when blended with local foods, created unique dishes.\nThe globalization of chili peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes completely changed the kitchens of the world."

        "1": "《The High School Debate Show: Product Placement》\nModerator: Welcome to The High School Debate Show!\nToday's debate topic is product placement.\nThe resolution is \"Product placement should be banned from television shows.\"\nFor your information, product placement is a form of advertising that involves inserting products in movies or TV programs with the intention of promoting the products or brands.\nWhile proven to be an effective way to advertise products, product placement has pros and cons, stirring arguments over whether or not it should be kept under control.\nNow we will hear the main arguments from both sides.",
        "2": "Team Haneul: We argue that product placement in TV shows should be banned.\nWe maintain our position in order to defend the rights of the general public, mainly television viewers, who are also product consumers.\nProduct placement does not extend benefits to the general public but interferes with their interests.\nIn this light, we offer three arguments against product placement ― the quality of the shows, the deprived choice of viewers, and the problem of invisible marketing costs.\nOur first point in argument is that product placement defeats the very purpose of TV shows, especially those in dramatic forms.\nThe primary purpose of dramas is to deliver a story, through which meaningful messages on society and the people living in it are delivered.\nViewers watch dramas planning to take their stories seriously and respond to the messages they deliver.\nProduct placement, on the other hand, aims to sell products.\nThese competing goals clash on the screen.\nWith random commercial brands popping out to steal the focus from the plot, the show quality suffers.",
        "3": "A hero in a K-drama was seen to take both his hands off the wheel while driving a car and kiss a girl in the passenger seat.\nIt was a product placement promoting an automatic pilot function of a new car.\nThe absurdity of the scene, totally out of the context, ruined what emotional sincerity the characters retained up to that point.\nWho could take a drama seriously when it is obviously more interested in selling products than in telling truthful stories?\nOur second point is that product placement doesn't give viewers a choice.\nUnlike commercials during breaks, there is no way for the viewer to avoid product placement.\nThe viewer is not given a choice over whether to watch it or not.\nProduct placement is advertising \"embedded\" in the program.\nThey are integrated in the show, meaning that it is not possible to turn off the TV or switch the channel to avoid them.",
        "4": "Our last point is that product placement is enormously expensive and costs companies that use it a lot of money.\nThese days, Korean TV shows have a global reach that hits billions of people, so inserting products in them has become costly.\nIn the end, the extra marketing costs for product placement are added to the product's consumer price, with the products promoted by product placement becoming more expensive,\nBased on these points, we believe that product placement should be banned from all media, but at a minimum from TV shows.",
        "5": "Moderator: Thank you for your excellent presentation.\nNow we're going to hear from the opposing side, Team Bada.\nTeam Bada: We, as the opposing team, are going to argue that product placement should not be banned.\nWe also prepared three supporting arguments ― the production funding in the new media environment, the better quality of program content, and other benefits of product placement in context.\nUnlike Team Haneul, we would like to approach the issue from a slightly different perspective, taking content creators and product companies into consideration.\nFirst, product placement is inevitable in the age of the new media environment.\nToday many people enjoy programs through mobile streaming services and video downloads.\nThe profit share from TV commercials is constantly declining, and production companies and broadcasting networks are compensating for the loss by attracting more product placements.\nFrom an idealistic point of view, the storytelling of TV dramas should not be interrupted by commercial advertising.\nFrom a realistic point of view, however, it is product placement that brings the programs to viewers.",
        "6": "Second, product placement does not harm but actually ensures the quality of TV shows.\nThe \"quality\" of a TV show is not only about storytelling.\nToday's media content creation is nothing like writing a novel.\nNowadays, high-quality media content requires a lot more elements such as expensive computer graphics, experienced directors, and even hallyu stars, but never can traditional funding support the increased cost.\nSuch high-quality content can only be achieved with product placement.\nProduct placement ruins the story only when it fails.\nWhen properly done, it may actually enhance the quality of sponsored programs.\nFor instance, in a K-drama about a blind girl's romance, there was a scene in which she applied lipstick on her own.\nIt was a product placement sponsored by a cosmetic company, but the scene was also essential to illustrate the girl's character-independent, attractive, and wealthy.\nNot only was the scene the talk of the town for breaking a media stereotype of blind people, but it also succeeded in establishing the character in the story.",
        "7": "Our last point is that product placement is helpful because it shows how the product is used in real life situations.\nSuppose that I wanted to buy a skirt, but I couldn't find one exactly to my taste.\nWhile watching a drama, I saw an actress wearing a skirt with a design that I had always wanted.\nIn this case, product placement helped me understand what I wanted by providing more information in context on a product I wanted to buy.\nThis also explains how K-dramas introduce Korean products to foreign consumers, which often results in global shopping sprees.\nFor example, a recent drama that became a huge hit in China was sponsored by a ginseng company.\nThe hero was frequently seen to drink ginseng extract from a small pouch.\nThe product became so popular among Chinese people that it instantly went out of stock.\nWith hallyu contents spreading all over the world, Korean products are being introduced to global consumers through product placement.\nBased on these points, we argue that product placement should not be banned.\nModerator: Thank you for your presentation.\nNow that we've heard from both teams, we are going to have a free debate session."

        "2": "《Going to Mars》\nBecause Mars is more than 100 times farther than the moon from Earth, reaching Mars requires serious hardware including a powerful rocket equipped with extremely fast computers.\nFor this purpose, a new generation of spacecraft is being designed and built at the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States.\nEven with such powerful rockets, however, a round trip to Mars would be difficult because it would take six months to go there.\nEven when the two planets are closest in their orbits, a round trip would take at least one year.\nToday's rockets and spacecraft cannot hold enough fuel for such an extended journey.\nWhile scientists are working to get around this problem, a European company has come up with a plan to launch a one-way trip with four astronauts to Mars, with additional crews joining them every two years to form a colony.\nThe world will have to wait several years to see if the plan works.",
        "3": "《Living on Mars》\nHumans need water, food, and oxygen to survive.\nWe have much more to learn about Mars, although much has already been discovered.\nThe most exciting finding about Mars is water, one of the most vital ingredients for life.\nNASA scientists have confirmed that Mars once had more water than the Antarctic Ocean and to this day some of it is locked up in Martian polar ice caps.\nScientists are trying to find effective ways to get water from the ice.\nThe next thing humans require is food.\nTo produce food on Mars, we need special farming technologies.\nWe can apply a special growing system that has been tested on the International Space Station (ISS).\nOf course, farming in space is not easy.\nPlants can be grown in space, but they require very careful management of gases, water, and dirt.\nOn Mars, the challenge will be more complex than on the ISS.\nIn addition to recovering water that is locked up in ice, the poor quality of the soil and the weak gravity of Mars need to be overcome.\nTherefore, success in farming on Mars might take decades or even centuries.\nUntil then, food could be printed by three-dimensional (3D) food printers.\nWith proteins and carbohydrates from various sources such as insects and leaves, 3D food printers can print pizzas and bread, among other foods.\nA scientist at NASA predicts that there will be 25 to 50 basic food items.\n\"We're not planning for food at fancy restaurants, but just healthy and nutritious meals,\" he says.\nAs for oxygen, plants might be used to produce it, and human waste might be recycled to provide nutrients for the plants.\nUntil there would be enough plants to produce sufficient amount of oxygen, NASA plans to use specially designed machines to convert the carbon dioxide in the Martian air into oxygen.",
        "4": "《Protecting Ourselves》\nAnother important issue involved in going to and living on Mars is our health.\nOur bodies work differently in space.\nOn Earth, gravity drags bodily fluids downwards, but in space this does not happen.\nThe heart has to work harder during space travel and on Mars to compensate for the weak or zero gravity.\nIn addition, weightlessness in space weakens bones and muscles.\nAstronauts on the ISS do a lot of exercise to avoid these problems, with additional help from drugs and artificial gravity from a spinning device.\nSimilar measures will be used on Mars.\nOne great threat to our body in space and on Mars is cosmic radiation.\nWhen we are outside the protection of Earth's air and magnetic field, we are exposed to cosmic radiation that damages our DNA and increases our risk for cancer.\nThe plan proposed so far is to cover space vehicles with radiation blocking materials and to build shelters beneath the surface of Mars.",
        "5": "《Reasons for Going There》\nThe final question is this: Do we really have to go to Mars, spending such enormous resources and risking people's lives?\nThat is a reasonable question.\nExperts answer by mentioning two kinds of benefits Martian exploration may bring:\npractical benefits and a sense of our shared destiny as the human race.\nPractical benefits are economic, educational, and political.\nSpace travel stimulates industry and draws people into careers in science and engineering.\nAnd while space exploration is a collaboration between countries to cover its high cost, having a space program raises any country's standing on the world stage.\nA sense of our shared destiny as the human race can be understood when considering the increasingly exhausted resources on Earth.\nWe humans need to find ways to survive before we consume all the available resources on Earth.\nThat is our shared destiny.\nMartian exploration can be seen as a step toward a human presence on another planet.\nIt is not an easy but a worthy dream for humanity.\n\"You can't really measure the value,\" says a scientist involved in a Martian project.\n\"If money is our only concern, everyone would study business.\nBut we also want to give meaning to our lives.\nThat's why dreams and passion appeal to humanity.\""

        "1": "《Failure Is Our Friend》\nNo one wants to fail.\nWe all want to succeed in everything we try and to avoid failure.\nNonetheless, failing and learning from our bitter experiences is necessary for success.\nIn fact, the most successful people are often people who have experienced many more failures than others.\nOne of the most famous examples of someone who learned from failure was Thomas Edison.\nHe was one of the world's greatest inventors, and he acquired over 1,000 patents.\nLike a wizard, he seemed to take ideas from thin air.\nHowever, he also faced tremendous difficulties.\nEdison is said to have failed 9,999 times before creating a perfect light bulb.\nUnlike the average person, Edison saw these mistakes not as failures but as an inevitable part of the invention process.\nIn response to a question about his errors, he once said, \"I have not failed 9,999 times.\nI've successfully found 9,999 ways that will not work.\"\nOf course, he was right.\nHe was able to achieve success after failing repeatedly.",
        "2": "These failures can not only motivate us to find a successful way to accomplish our goal but also help us to grow in wisdom and in spirit.\nToni Morrison began writing when she was in college, but she did not produce anything good enough to publish for many years.\nHer troubled marriage, divorce, and life as a single mother made it even harder for her to write.\nAt 39, she published her first novel, The Bluest Eye, which received mixed reviews and did not sell well.\nHowever, all her hardships added depth to her novels and encouraged her to improve her writing skills.\nLater in her life, Morrison wrote masterpieces such as Song of Solomon, Beloved, and Jazz.\nIn 1993, she became the first African-American woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.",
        "3": "Sometimes failure can lead us to success by showing us that we are not good at something.\nThe fashion designer Vera Wang, for example, found a path to success, thanks to her failure.\nAt the age of seven, she began devoting herself to figure skating, hoping to compete in the Olympics.\nWhen she was 19, however, she failed to make the U.S. Olympic team and quit figure skating.\nShe experienced a brutal letdown.\nWhile staying in Paris, she happened to discover her passion for and talent in fashion design, which led her to move to fashion as a career.\nAfter returning to America, she started working as a salesperson in a clothing store.\nDeveloping her career from editor of a fashion magazine to design director for a global brand for about 20 years, she eventually ended up designing clothes on her own.\nToday, Vera Wang is a world-famous designer whose elegant dresses are sought after by celebrities the world over.",
        "4": "Still, wouldn't it be even better if we could be successful without ever failing?\nWe may think so, but in the end, performing without failure doesn't necessarily produce lasting success.\nAll success with no failure often leads a person to arrogance and carelessness.\nAs a result, the always successful person or organization could suddenly encounter a disaster.\nBetween the 1960s and the 1980s, NASA, the U.S. agency in charge of researching and exploring space, completed one successful mission after another with no significant failure.\nIn 1968, it launched Apollo 8, the first manned spacecraft to fly around the moon.\nIn 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the moon, and the NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person in history to walk on the moon.",
        "5": "During the following years, NASA successfully sent five other rockets to the moon.\nEven when the oxygen tank in Apollo 13 exploded on its way to the moon in 1970, its entire crew was rescued, and they were able to return home safely.\nThis continued series of successes made the decision-makers at NASA too self-assured and unable to imagine failure.\nIn 1986, NASA planned to send its second space shuttle, Challenger, into orbit.\nRight before the launch, engineers expressed concerns about mechanical malfunctions and advised that the launching be postponed.\nHowever, NASA managers did not take their warnings seriously and launched Challenger as planned.\nChallenger broke apart 73 seconds after it was launched, resulting in the deaths of its seven crew members.",
        "6": "Edison, Morrison, and Wang all suffered big failures, but they never gave up.\nThey learned from their mistakes and went on to experience even greater triumphs.\nLike many successful people, we should view failure not as the opposite of success, but as an indispensable step on the path to reach success.\nAfter all, the only way to avoid failures is to do nothing.\nJ.K. Rowling said that suffering many failures in her life eventually enabled her to write the Harry Potter series.\nShe remarked, \"Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way.\"\nBy risking and confronting failures and learning from them, we can become wiser and stronger."

        "2": "《From the Film Camera to the Digital Camera》\nBefore the digital camera was invented, we had the film camera.\nIt captured an image on a piece of film every time we took a picture.\nOnce used, the film could not be erased or reused.\nTo take pictures, photographers needed not only a camera, but also film, which they had to buy every time they wanted to take another photograph.\nFurthermore, taking a photograph required knowledge, skill, and practice.\nA photographer needed to learn how to decide an adequate composition for the picture, to adjust the focal length, and to set the film and the shutter speed before shooting.\nIt was important to prepare carefully if a person was going to take a good photograph, because it was nearly impossible to change anything once the photograph had been taken.\nThe digital camera has changed all that.\nSince today's digital cameras store photographs in the form of digital images, no film is needed.\nIn other words, taking pictures with a digital camera is practically free.\nAs a result, most people are taking far more photographs than ever they would have before.\nIn the past, when a family took a trip to the countryside for the weekend, they might have taken 10 to 20 photographs.\nToday, many families will take 100 to 200 pictures during the same countryside trip.\nWhen they return home, they can choose the shots they want to keep and discard the rest.",
        "3": "The discarded pictures cost them nothing, except perhaps a little time.\nMoreover, the digital camera has made it astonishingly easy to take photographs by making all the shooting processes automatic.\nPeople who know next to nothing about photography can still produce high-quality photographs.\nThe transition from the film camera to the digital camera has changed our idea about what to take pictures of.\nWhen photographers used film in the past, each photo cost money.\nThus, people took pictures mostly on special occasions, such as weddings, graduations, and trips to exotic places.\nNow we can take pictures of anything we want, whenever we want.\nNo one thinks that taking a picture of tonight's dinner, a lovely pet, or a book you like, is strange or a waste of money.",
        "4": "《The Smartphone and Citizen Journalism》\nBy integrating the mobile phone and the camera, the smartphone has further transformed the way we use and think about photography.\nNowadays, whenever we want to take a picture, our camera is already in our hand, in our smartphone.\nThe smartphone has also made it easier to share our photographs with others since smartphones come with a wireless Internet connection and social networking apps.\nThese features of the smartphone have resulted in new picture-taking habits.\nTaking a photograph of oneself was difficult and not often done in the past.\nHowever, the smartphone made it so convenient and popular that taking a photograph of oneself, or a selfie, is now one of the most common types of photography on the Internet.\nIt can be said that the smartphone lets everyone use photography as a tool for self-expression.",
        "5": "The smartphone also enables ordinary people to gather, report, and spread news without relying on the mainstream media, such as newspapers or television.\nThis practice is called citizen journalism.\nThanks to citizen journalists, inappropriate or inconsiderate behaviors such as leaving one's pet's droppings on the street or abusing a bus driver are quickly photographed and reported online.\nInternationally, citizen journalism has played a crucial role in letting the world know the realities of major world events, such as the earthquake in Haiti and the Arab Spring.",
        "6": "By any measure, the world today is far different from the world as it was in the film Argo.\nThere are infinitely more photographs and amateur photographers now than there were 40 years ago.\nSome people worry that these changes have made us preoccupied with taking pictures and flooding the Internet with too many unimportant images.\nThere may be some truth in that, but it cannot be denied that technology today has made photography an essential part of our culture and that it has altered the way people see the world."

        "2": "Returning to Seoul after the war, Kim Whanki felt a strong desire to capture the essence of the beauty found in traditional Korean art.\nHe collected old Korean paintings and pottery.\nHe especially loved large white porcelain moon jars.\nWhen he was asked why moon jars attracted him so much, he said, \"Korean jars have broadened my idea of beauty.\nThe jars are like curious textbooks for my paintings.\"\nAlong with jars, he often included mountains, plum blossoms, and the moon as subjects in his paintings.\nPaintings like Jars and Plum Blossoms and Jar and Moon represent his love of Korean pottery and other traditional objects.\nAt the time, his painting style was semi-abstract; viewers could see certain forms in his paintings although the objects were simplified.",
        "3": "By the early 1950s, although Kim Whanki had become successful as an artist, he was not satisfied with being an outstanding painter only within Korea.\nIn 1956, he resigned from the college and went to Paris, where he lived for three years.\nHe concentrated on delivering the beauty of traditional Korean objects on canvas to the people of France.\nDuring this period, objects were given more simplified shapes, and his art became more abstract.\nIn his famous work Song of Eternity, he included natural objects from the sipjangsaeng, the 10 symbols of eternal life, such as water, stones, mountains, clouds, and pine trees.\nIt was praised by art critics for combining Asian concepts and ideals with abstraction.",
        "4": "Kim Whanki returned to Seoul in 1959 and quickly regained his fame as a prominent artist.\nIn 1963 at the age of 50, he became the first Korean artist to be invited to the São Paulo Art Biennale in Brazil.\nMeeting artists from all over the world and seeing their works, he decided to go directly from São Paulo to New York to challenge himself and extend his artistic boundaries.\nLife in New York was not easy.\nIn the beginning, he received negative reviews from critics.\nOnce an art dealer lied to him and sold his paintings without paying him.\nOn another occasion, a group of paintings were lost during an exhibition.\nWith loneliness and financial difficulty, he tried to find a way to survive in New York as an artist.",
        "5": "During his 11 years in New York, Kim Whanki's style eventually reached complete abstraction.\nHe gradually took away figures and filled his canvases with basic elements such as dots and lines.\nHis masterpiece, completed in 1970, Where, in What Form, Shall We Meet Again?, is covered with thousands of blue dots.\nThe title was taken from a famous poem by Kim Kwangsup, which is about looking at the stars and longing for loved ones.\nKim Whanki explained, \"The dots are the faces of all my friends in Korea.\nThe faces I was longing for became the stars in my mind and the dots in my painting.\"\nStarting with that work, he began to use only dots and created his own unique style called \"dot painting.\"\nIn dot paintings, he filled big canvases with countless dots.\nMost of these paintings were in his characteristic blue tones, which represented the color of the sea near his hometown.",
        "6": "《In the Evening (Kim Kwangsup)》\nOf all those numerous stars,\none in particular looks down upon me.\nOf all these countless people,\nmy eyes are set upon one particular star.\nAs the night grows deeper,\nit fades into brightness\nand I disappear into darkness.\nWhere, in what form\nshall the two of us...\nyou, one so warm, and me, one so tender,\nmeet again?",
        "7": "Kim Whanki passed away in New York in 1974.\nThroughout his entire life, his artistic passion never grew old or became weak.\nAlmost half a century has passed since his death, but his art is still highly respected.\nMeanwhile, his life story helps us realize how important it is to be true to and passionate about our dreams and ideals."

        "1": "《My Trip to Penang》\nLast winter, my family and I visited Penang Island, Malaysia.\nI had always been interested in Malaysia because it is a multicultural country, where Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and traditional Malay cultures coexist with European influences.\nIn addition, we chose Penang as our destination because it is famous for its street art, something that both my mother and I are interested in.\nPenang is a tropical island located off the northwest coast of Malaysia.\nIts capital, George Town, was built by British settlers in the late 18th century and named after King George III.\nAs a center of trade between the East and the West, George Town has been home to a diverse population for a long time and has many beautiful, historically important buildings.\nFor these reasons, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
        "2": "In the last week of January, my family and I flew to Penang.\nAs soon as we entered George Town, I was struck by its unique beauty.\nEuropean- and Asian-style buildings stood side by side, and many buildings looked neither completely Western nor completely Eastern but a mixture of the two.\nHaving left our luggage at the hotel, my family and I walked around the city.\nFirst, we stopped at a nearby restaurant and had asam laksa for lunch.\nLaksa is a spicy noodle soup that blends Chinese and Malay cuisine.\nPeople from different regions and cultures have invented different types of laksa.\nPenang asam laksa is made with fresh seafood and has a sour, spicy taste.\nAt first I thought it looked like Kalguksu in a Korean Ramyeon sauce, but with a strange smell.\nWhen I tasted it, however, I found it was really delicious.\nThe soup was very rich, and its sour, spicy taste was very refreshing.\nAfter finishing lunch, we visited some famous, old buildings.\nAmong them, my favorite was Blue Mansion, a large, luxurious house built in the 19th century.\nPainted in vivid blue and built in a style that combined Chinese and European architecture, it was both beautiful and unique at the same time.",
        "4": "We also saw some of Penang's famous street art on Armenian Street and more on nearby Cannon Street.\nI was amazed by the diverse styles of murals.\nSome of them were quite realistic, while others were artistically simplified or somewhat abstract.\nA few combined actual things such as a bicycle or a cart with paintings on the wall.\nI was also surprised to learn that these works of art were created not only by local people but also by artists from all parts of the world.\nA famous mural of two children riding a bicycle, for example, was created by a famous artist named Ernest Zacharevic.\nMy favorite pieces were the mural of a very large cat and another painting of two cute little owls.",
        "5": "On the last day of our trip, we visited the Little Penang Street Market, a street market that is held on the last Sunday of each month.\nIt was one of the reasons why we decided to take this trip near the end of January.\nThe Little Penang Street Market is known as the best place to see local crafts, and it really was full of beautiful ethnic goods, including clothes, shoes, wood carvings, woven baskets, and much more.\nThe atmosphere was so lively and exciting that the entire event felt more like a small festival than a market.\nMy parents bought a small wooden sculpture of a monkey.\nThe seller explained that it was traditional artwork made by the Orang Asli, the inhabitants who have lived in Malaysia longer than anyone else.\nAfter having lunch at a food stall, we left for the airport.",
        "6": "On our way home, I thought that Malaysia and Korea might have more in common than I had originally imagined.\nLike Korea, Malaysia was occupied by other countries but overcame this tragic history to achieve economic and cultural development.\nI was deeply impressed by how the Malaysians have embraced their diversity and how it has made its culture richer.\nKorea is also becoming an increasingly diverse country.\nThe trip to Penang makes me wonder what Seoul will be like in the future."

        "3": "The next day, we went to see some impressive historical temples.\nFirst, we stopped by the Kapitan Keling Mosque, the largest Mosque in George Town.\nVisitors wearing shorts are not allowed to enter, so I had to borrow a long skirt to get in.\nThen, we went to see Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, which is covered with colorful carvings of countless Hindu gods and goddesses.\nLastly, we visited Kek Lok Si, the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia located in a suburb of George Town.\nIt was terrific to see how all these different religious temples coexist in the same area.\nOn the third day, we went to Armenian Street.\nIt is called that because many Armenian immigrants moved to this district in the 19th century.\nHowever, they did not stay long, and soon Chinese traders replaced them.\nAs a result, many of the buildings on Armenian Street have unusual appearances.\nThey appear to have been designed and begun by Europeans but decorated and finished by Chinese.\nAlthough there were many white buildings, some badly in need of paint, there were also many other buildings painted in yellow, pink, orange, and brick-red.\nThe colorfulness and slightly different decorations of the buildings made the whole street look really delightful."

        "1": "《How Potatoes Changed the World》\nFrench fries, which are often served with fast foods, are one of the best known American side dishes.\nIt is said that Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, tasted these fried potatoes in France and brought the recipe home to America.\nThe real inventors of the so-called \"French\" fries were not the French but the Belgians.\nInstead of French fries, the French have traditionally enjoyed roasted potatoes with chicken for their Sunday lunch.\nPotato pancakes and potato soups are popular traditional dishes in Germany, while fish and chips is one of the most popular street foods in England.",
        "2": "The potato has become such an important part of Western food culture that it is hard to believe that it has had such a relatively short history in Europe.\nThe potato has been grown by South American Indians in the Andes Mountains for nearly 10,000 years, but it was only 500 years ago when the Europeans learned about this vegetable and brought it to their homelands.\nAt first, Europeans did not like this unfamiliar and alien food.\nMost people thought potatoes looked too ugly for people to eat.\nSome even believed that potatoes were created by devils.\nFor this reason, potatoes were most often given to animals, while people ate them only when there was nothing else to eat.\nThe potato gradually but steadily spread across Europe, as people learned how it could help them in times of war, bad weather, and desperate hunger.",
        "3": "《The End of Hunger》\nHunger was a common part of everyday life in 17th- and 18th-century Europe.\nThe average European not only often went hungry, but sometimes even starved to death.\nMany countries suffered nationwide famines at least once every decade.\nThe potato changed all that.\nNot only did potatoes grow well in much of Europe, but they were also very nutritious.\nOnce Europeans began to grow potatoes, their food supplies doubled in quantity and increased dramatically in quality.\nThroughout Europe, potatoes quickly became the main source of nutrition for the majority of common people.\nBy the end of the 18th century, potatoes had taken over most European farms, and famine had become a rare and unusual incident.\nAt long last, Europe was able to feed itself.",
        "4": "《The Industrial Revolution》\nThanks to the fact that the potato was inexpensive and nutritious, many Europeans escaped famines, and the populations in European nations increased rapidly during the 19th century.\nFurthermore, the potato indirectly led to the Industrial Revolution in 19th century England.\nIt was easier to grow potatoes than many other crops, so fewer people were needed for farming.\nPeople who no longer worked on farms came to the cities and became factory workers, enabling new manufacturing industries to grow more quickly.\nWith the larger populations and more advanced technologies, European nations became powerful enough to venture into other parts of the world and colonize them.",
        "5": "《The Irish Famine》\nThe impact of the potato in Europe was not entirely positive.\nIt was much more complicated.\nBecause the people of Ireland were excessively dependent upon the potato for food, when a potato disease hit Europe in 1845, it led to a disastrous situation.\nMany countries were affected, but Ireland suffered the most.\nIn two months, the disease wiped out almost half of the potato crop in Ireland.\nThe situation continued to worsen.\nBy 1852, more than one million Irish people, about 20 percent of the population, had starved to death, while another two million people had fled Ireland, and almost three-quarters of them had migrated to the United States.\nIt was one of the deadliest famines in history.",
        "6": "《The Beginning of the Modern Pesticides》\nDespite the terrible outcome of the potato disease in Europe, it was perhaps less important in the potato's history than the Colorado potato beetle was in North America.\nIn the 1860s, the potato beetle was carried by horses and cows from Mexico to the state of Colorado in the United States.\nThere it attacked potatoes and spread quickly when potatoes were shipped to other parts of the country on trains and steamships.\nUntil that time, American farmers had only planted a few varieties of potatoes, and the potatoes that they planted were extremely vulnerable to the pest.\nAs a result, farmers were practically defenseless against this pest.\nAfter a series of desperate attempts, one man eventually found that Paris green, a toxic chemical used for making green paint, killed the beetles.\nSoon farmers were spraying it on their potatoes.\nFarmers were not the only people to find a new use for Paris green.\nChemists saw what the farmers were doing and decided to try Paris green on other pests.\nThey then decided to try other chemicals for other problems.\nScientists began to do research and discover chemicals and substances that were effective for many different agricultural problems.\nThat was the beginning of the modern pesticide industry.",
        "7": "Often, the course of history is changed by seemingly insignificant things.\nIn this case, it was changed by the potato.\nThe potato changed Europe first by freeing the European people from hunger.\nIt then went on to prepare the ground for the Industrial Revolution, the rise of the European empires, and new techniques in farming.\nAs a result, this simple vegetable, which was once unwanted and thought to be ugly, has shaped the modern world as we know it."

        "1": "《Why Sinkholes Open Up》\n《Florida Sinkhole Swallowed a Sleeping Man》\nWhen Jeff Bush, a 37-year-old Florida man, screamed out for help, his brother Jeremy ran into Jeff's bedroom.\nSeeing that Jeff and all his furnishings had vanished into the earth, Jeremy desperately tried to rescue him.\nHe didn't stop until the police arrived.\n\"I tried so hard. I tried everything I could, but I couldn't get him out,\" Jeremy cried.\nIt was a sinkhole that instantly pulled Jeff into the earth.\nA sinkhole is a hole that opens up in the ground, which is caused by a collapse of the land surface.\nSinkholes vary in size from 1 to 600 meters deep.\nSome sinkholes are large enough to swallow entire buildings.\nSinkholes have been around for a long time.\nIt is said that the ancient Maya believed sinkholes were passageways to the world of the dead.",
        "2": "Unlike the sinkhole in Florida, not all sinkholes are dangerous, destructive, and ruinous.\nSome sinkholes attract tourists who are interested in the mystery and the beauty of nature.\nSome notable sinkholes include Sima Humboldt in Venezuela, which is 314 meters deep and Xiaozhai Tiankeng in China, 662 meters deep and 626 meters wide.\nSinkholes can form underwater, too.\nUnderwater sinkholes are called blue holes.\nThe Great Blue Hole in Belize is one of the most spectacular; it is 300 meters wide and 124 meters deep.",
        "3": "Sinkholes typically occur in areas where the rock beneath the surface soil is limestone, carbonate rock, sandstone, or some other soft rock that is easily worn away by water.\nThese kinds of rocks are found in many parts of Florida, Texas, and Kentucky in the U.S.\nThey are also common in the U.K., Mexico, Belize, Slovenia, Croatia, and China.\nWhen rainwater seeps down through surface soil, it eventually reaches bedrock below.\nSlowly and continually, sometimes taking hundreds or thousands of years, the water erodes small parts of the rock, creating cracks underground.\nAs the process continues, the soil above is gradually washed into the cracks, and it creates a space in the soil.\nIt is not seen on the surface.\nAs the space becomes too large to support the soil above, it collapses, and a hole opens up on the surface.\nThough sinkholes form gradually, the final collapse of the surface happens suddenly.",
        "5": "The most common factor that triggers a collapse is a change in underground water levels.\nFor example, during long periods of drought, underground water levels will fall.\nWhen this happens, the space that was once supported by the water may become weaker and collapse.\nAnother trigger is a rapid increase in surface water.\nA sudden heavy rain can add dramatically to the weight of the surface soil, making it too heavy for the space beneath to bear.\nThis, too, can bring about a collapse.\nSometimes the trigger can be man-made.\nMost sinkholes we are seeing these days are indirectly related to human activities, such as drilling, mining, or construction.\nThey may also occur because of broken water pipes, heavy weight on soft soil, and the removal of groundwater.\nCollapses from these man-made causes can have especially dramatic effects because they often occur in the middle of a street or in housing areas.",
        "6": "Recently, many sinkholes have opened up in urban areas around the world, sometimes resulting in tragic accidents.\nIn 2010, in Guatemala City, an area approximately 20 meters wide and 30 meters deep collapsed, swallowing a three story factory and killing 15 people.\nThe sinkhole was caused by the increase of surface water due to tropical storm Agatha and leakage from a local waste water pipe.\nGenerally speaking, naturally occurring sinkholes cannot be prevented.\nHowever, if you live in an area where sinkholes have happened before, look around for possible warnings, such as leaning trees, doors or windows that don't close properly, or rainwater collecting in unusual spots.\nSinkholes caused by human carelessness can often be prevented.\nThorough soil testing prior to construction and maintaining the underground water and plumbing systems are the best ways to prevent the formation of a sinkhole in the middle of a city.",
        "7": "Sinkholes are not widespread events like hurricanes or earthquakes.\nThey are very localized.\nHowever, this does not mean that we should ignore the possibility of sinkholes.\nAs our population grows and we develop in areas where sinkholes are common, we seem to be seeing more sinkholes and more stories about humans being affected by them.\nIf we look for ways to detect and prevent sinkholes, it may be easier to rescue another Jeff from a sinkhole somewhere else in the world."

        "1": "《Provide Access to Clean Water》\nWhen Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote \"water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink,\" he did not have the 21st century's global water situation in mind.\nBut he wasn't far from correct about the present world's water situation.\nToday, the availability of water for drinking and other uses is a critical problem in many areas of the world.",
        "2": "《How serious is our water challenge?\nNowadays, the lack of clean water causes more deaths than war.\nOne out of every six people living today does not have adequate access to water, and more than double that number live in unhealthy environments because they lack the water they need for cleaning.\nIn some countries, half the population does not have access to safe drinking water.\nAs a result, people living in these countries have many health problems.\nNearly 5,000 children globally die every day from diseases caused by the lack of clean water.\nIf sufficient water for sanitation were available, these children would be saved.\nIs water really scarce?\nEarth is sometimes called \"the Blue Planet\" because it is covered by so much water.\nIn fact, Earth does contain over a billion trillion liters of water.\nHowever, very little of that water is safe to drink.\nOver 97% of the water on Earth is salt water.\nOf the fresh water that remains, over two thirds is locked away in ice caps and glaciers.\nMost of the rest is trapped in the soil or underground.\nBut that amount is enough for now.",
        "3": "Then why is the water crisis so severe?\nBecause groundwater, mostly deposited in earlier times, is being exhausted far faster than it is being replaced.\nMoreover, it is not always located where it is needed.\nFor example, Canada has far more water than its people need, while the Middle East, North Africa, and many other regions are always in want of water.\nEven within specific countries, such as Brazil, some regions have more than enough fresh, unpolluted water while other regions often suffer from droughts.\nAnd it is not just drinking water that is needed.\nWater for drinking and personal use is only a small portion of society's total water needs — household water usually accounts for less than 5 percent of total water use.\nMost of the fresh water we use is for agriculture and industrial activities.\nIn addition, water is also inevitably needed for ecological processes not directly related to human use.\nOvercoming the crisis in water and sanitation is one of the toughest human challenges of the early 21st century.",
        "4": "《So what solutions are out there?》\nToday, we need more sophisticated and controlling water supply methods that do not only meet our increased needs but also prevent damage to the environment and ecosystems.\nOne large-scale approach used in the U.S., China, India, and other countries has been to divert the flow of water from regions where it is plentiful to where it is scarce.\nSuch diversion projects provide some short-term relief for cities, but they are not practical as widespread or long-term solutions and have ecologically damaging effects.\nAnother problem is that diverting water to some people often means less for others, and this can become an explosive political issue potentially.\nAnother approach that can be applied is desalination.\nDesalination is extracting the salt from seawater.\nDesalination is not a new idea and is already used in many regions, particularly in the Middle East.\nSaudi Arabia produces about one tenth of the water produced by desalination in the world.\nIsrael uses desalination technology to provide about a fourth of its domestic water needs.\nMore than 12,000 desalination plants are now in operation in the world.\nBut desalination plants are expensive to build and require lots of energy to operate, which makes desalination suitable mainly for seaside cities in rich countries.\nIt therefore has limited value for poor countries, where water supply problems are the most serious.\nIf desalination is going to be a realistic source of fresh water, countries need either abundant, cheap energy or a way to make the process more efficient.",
        "5": "A different technological approach is used for irrigation systems.\nAgricultural irrigation consumes enormous quantities of water; in developing countries, irrigation often exceeds 80 percent of total water use.\nOne of the earliest and most widespread forms is flood irrigation.\nIt involves pumping or diverting water to fields so that water flows along the ground among the crops.\nIt is simple and cheap, but also inefficient and wasteful.\nImproved technologies such as \"drip irrigation\" can drip water directly onto plants.\nIt can provide crops with water more efficiently and significantly reduce agricultural water demand.\nAlready some countries, such as Jordan, have dramatically reduced water use with drip technology.\nHowever, this is not a perfect solution because it does not provide enough water to cleanse the soil.\nTechnologies are being developed, for instance, to improve recycling of waste water so that it can be used for irrigation or industrial purposes.\nHopefully, recycled water may someday even be returned to groundwater.\nHowever, very effective purification methods and thorough safeguards are necessary to ensure the safety of recycled water.",
        "6": "Above are large-scale solutions for providing a huge amount of water.\nHowever, a small-scale process has also been used to improve water availability and safety.\nIt is a small distillation unit, which is a particularly attractive approach in rural and low-income areas, where the lack of infrastructure makes it hard to distribute water efficiently and economically.\nSome current projects have produced inexpensive distillation units that can remove toxic elements from any water source.\nA unit smaller than a dishwasher can provide daily clean water for 100 people.\nToday, the earth's population is seven billion.\nBy 2050, the global population is expected to rise to nine billion.\nAs a result, there have been significant calls for a change in the way the world is dealing with growing water shortages.\nAlbert Einstein once described madness as \"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nTraditional approaches to water use and conservation cannot solve the water crises of the future.\nWe must, as Einstein points out, do something different.\nThe world's water problems can only be solved by better technologies and more imaginative innovations."

        "2": "《Artistic Design Comes First》\nMost of all, artistic design should be considered for an advertisement to be both creative and effective.\nFirst, among the many factors used in design — color contrast, balance, rhythm, and more — the golden ratio is a great tool used to make an impressive advertisement.\nLet's have a little math talk here.\nThe rule of the golden ratio based on the number phi (ϕ=1.61803398874...) was discovered by Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician.\nPhi (ϕ) is the ratio between the number series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, where the next number in the series is created by adding two neighboring numbers together.\nSo, 1+1=2, and 1+2=3 and on it goes.\nWhen we divide two neighboring numbers (for example 3 into 5 is 1.666... and 13 into 21 is 1.615...) the ratio between them becomes closer to ϕ(1.618...).",
        "3": "What's so amazing about this ratio?\nIt's the fact that it has had a large impact on the design of advertisements and fonts.\nAlso, recent studies show that people find logos using the golden ratio very attractive and balanced.\nMany of the most popular brands make a perfect balance in their logos, making use of the golden ratio to which our eyes are attracted.\nIn addition, typography is a creative tool with which you can add extra artistic features to an advertisement.\nIt is about designing letters to make the written messages more appealing.\nTypography is very effective because words are usually the first thing a person sees, and they can be used to express the overall feeling of the content.\nThis means that a person can immediately understand what the ads are about.",
        "4": "《Readable Language Reads Well》\nComing up with a catchy advertising slogan is essential for an effective advertisement.\nKeep it short — around six to eight words.\nIt should grab the consumers' attention and convince them that your product is better than the others.\nTo do this, advertisement designers use diverse strategies.\nHere is a collection of creative advertisements that uses rhymes and humor to make us think more about the product.\nThis is a potato chips advertisement using a rhyme: \"Once you pop, you can't stop!\"\nThis asserts its message in a more memorable and clearer way.\nIt's much more effective than saying, \"These potato chips are delicious.\"\nHumor also works in advertisements.\nThis sign's slogan reads, \"I'm a beach, NOT an enormous ashtray, okay?\"\nWhat is this public advertisement trying to say?\nIt is trying to encourage people not to leave cigarettes on the beach.\nBy humorously making the beach seem human, eight simple words can make people feel that the beach is talking to them.",
        "5": "《Technology Trends Matter》\nFinally, it's neither the design nor the slogan alone that makes an advertisement creative.\nYou also need the perfect medium by which your advertisements are made available to the public.\nUsually, experts on advertising divide media into two categories: \"old\" and \"new\" media.\nOld media include television, newspapers, and magazines.\nRecently, advertisements have begun to use new media led by the Internet, mobile devices (tablets and smartphones), and digital signage.\nSimply put, digital signage refers to huge digital screens on which pictures and videos are displayed.\nIt allows supersize advertisements to be freely displayed in public places like subway stations and movie theaters.\nThe most important characteristic of new media is interactivity.\nIn other words, it communicates with consumers using various technologies simultaneously including so-called big data analysis for personalized advertisements.\nLet's say you want to grab a bite to eat after you exercise.\nOn the way home, you spot a large digital screen with fresh fruit on it.\nYour smartphone recognizes a QR code on the screen with which you can be informed of the location of a fruit store.\nWhile you read the store information, a list of other recommended stores pops up on your smartphone, so you can pick and choose where to buy your fruit.\nYou now know that an advertisement is a combination of ARTs.\nAs the old saying goes, the more you know, the more you see.\nSo, from now on, see if you can find any of the three ARTistic factors whenever you see a wide array of advertisements.\nYou will be surprised how much this can help you learn about creative ideas.",
        "6": "《Creative Public Service Advertisements》\nWhile the objective of a commercial advertisement is to sell a product, a public service ad is intended to change the public awareness of an issue to affect people's attitudes and change their behaviors.\nAdvertising, in its noncommercial form, can be a powerful educational tool which is capable of reaching and motivating large audiences.\nCreative public service ads not only attract people's attention, but try to make them think about the issue, encouraging them to take a stand against unfairness in the world.\nWhile you can enjoy the creative skills used to create the ads on the left side, you can also share them to raise awareness of the issue.\nYou are also encouraged to propose your own creative solution to a problem that occurs in your own community.\nSo get inspired!\nSlower is Better : If a car travels faster than the speed limit, the monitor displays its speed on the board.\nStop Killing : By making us think of a dead seal, the poster shows that buying leather shoes is directly connected to killing animals."

        "1": "《Feelings Are Mutual》\nWhen you look at an image of a person yawning, what is your reaction?\nEven reading about yawning can make you yawn, too.\nDon't you feel like yawning right now?\nIf so, you are not alone.\nAbout half of all people actually yawn after they see someone else yawn.\nThe reason for this universal phenomenon of contagious yawning has long been investigated by many scientists.\nRecent studies reveal that this contagious phenomenon is related to empathy — as you may have heard, this is the ability to understand others' emotional states.\nMany scientists suggest that our feelings of empathy are made possible by a special group of nerve cells called mirror neurons.\nIt is the mirror neuron that enables us to \"mirror\" others' emotions.\nIt is said that the discovery of mirror neurons has helped scientists explain the reason for empathy.\nSo how were mirror neurons discovered?\nThey were discovered by accident.\nIn Parma, Italy, a monkey sat in a laboratory chair.\nThin wires had been connected to the region of its brain involved in carrying out movements.\nEvery time the monkey moved an object, some cells in that brain region would send a signal, and a monitor would make a beeping sound.\nNeurons are the main cells that make up your brain and the rest of the nervous system.\nYour brain has 100 billion neurons.",
        "2": "One day a researcher entered the lab with some nuts.\nThe monkey was staring at him.\nThen, something strange happened.\nWhen the researcher raised the nuts to his lips, the monitor sounded — beep — even though the monkey had not moved anything, but had simply observed the researcher moving the nuts.\nThe researcher couldn't understand why the monitor made the sound.\nJust to make sure, the researcher raised the nuts again, and he heard another beep.\nThis suggested that the monkey experienced the same emotion from seeing the man move the nuts as if the monkey itself had moved them.\nIt was then that the scientists found some neurons that are involved in both doing a task and seeing someone else do it.",
        "3": "《Mirror Neurons in Our Life》\nHave you seen or experienced any of these situations? Select Yes or No.\nWhen you listen to a tune that you can play, you move your hands and nod as if you were actually playing it yourself.\nEven the youngest babies imitate the facial expressions of other people and take on their emotions.\nWhen you see someone hit his elbow on the corner of a desk, you react as if you hit your own elbow because you know how painful it is.\nSome sports fans feel so emotionally involved that they react almost as if they were part of the game themselves.",
        "4": "So why is this discovery of mirror neurons important?\nMirror neurons are important in that they give us a real sense of what it means to put yourself in another person's shoes.\nIn other words, if it were not for the actions of mirror neurons, people would have more difficulties in understanding other people's feelings.\nMany people know that babies love it when their parents smile at them and hate it when their parents show negative emotions on their faces.\nWhen a baby sees the facial expressions and body postures of others, mirror neurons stimulate the same internal responses.\nThen their muscles mirror the same emotions.\nChildren later understand others' feelings through mirror neurons and learn how to behave in an emotionally appropriate manner.",
        "5": "Not only do mirror neurons play a key role in human empathy, but they also accelerate the evolution of the brain, explaining the origin of language and culture.\nMany scientists view mirror neurons as the foundation of language development.\nAt the heart of these scientists' theory is the unique human ability for complex imitation.\nThey argue that being able to imitate another person's actions promotes not only a child's ability to acquire a language, but also an adult's ability to use language.\nSince the time when human beings began activating mirror neurons and learning through imitation, human languages and cultures have developed by leaps and bounds.\nThis is why some scientists call the mirror neurons the \"neurons that built civilization.\"",
        "6": "Little did scientists expect that they would make this wonderful discovery.\nBut this accidental discovery has made it possible for scientists to better understand the development of human behavior and civilization.\nIn the past, people believed that there was no relationship between what we see and how we behave.\nIt was the discovery of mirror neurons that proved this belief to be wrong.\nBased on this theory, people should be more careful about what they watch because some people who are in the habit of watching violent videos are likely to imitate what they see.\nThey could imitate the violence without being able to notice the differences between fantasy and reality.\nSo the next time you choose a TV program or movie to watch, you might want to think seriously about how it could affect your actual behavior through mirror neurons.",
        "7": "《Empathy and Language Learning》\nEmpathy is the ability to step into other people's shoes and to seek to understand their feelings and how they see the world.\nIt is also empathy that we need to activate if we really wish to learn another language to the highest level.\nHere are three habits of highly empathetic people who are successful language learners!\n1. Highly empathetic people challenge their own bias by searching for what they share with people rather than what divides them.\nThis makes them want to talk to all kinds of people, a key requirement for someone who wants to learn another language.\n2. Highly empathetic people are willing to interact with others, putting into practice the proverb, \"Never criticize a person until you have walked a mile in his or her shoes.\"\nThis is an important factor in language learning.\n3. An empathetic conversationalist can master the art of listening.\nAn empathetic listener listens carefully to others and does all he or she can to get behind the words they are using to sense their emotional state and needs.\nIn the end, while there are many factors involved in language learning, empathy is one of the crucial factors that will make the journey even quicker."

Lee Taeseok spent nine years in southern Sudan until his death.\nHe used all of his talents to serve the people whose lives were destroyed after a long civil war.\nHe treated people suffering from diseases by building a hospital and digging wells for clean water.\nHe also built schools and taught people how to play instruments to heal their wounded hearts.\nLiving for others, Dr. Jang and Fr.

        "2": "《The Earth Travels Really Fast》\nWhich do you think travels faster, an airplane or the earth?\nAn ordinary passenger airplane can travel at the speed of about 800 kilometers per hour.\nAlthough the earth seems motionless, it spins much faster than you might think.\nLet's do some simple math here to figure out how fast our planet is spinning.\nThe earth is 40,044 kilometers round at the equator.\n40,044 kilometers divided by 24 hours is 1,668.5 kilometers per hour, or about 463 meters per second.\nThis rotation speed is even greater than 340 meters per second, which is the speed of sound.\nSo the earth is spinning faster than the speed of a passenger airplane or the speed of sound.\nThe earth also revolves around the sun.\nHow fast is this rotation?\nThe speed of the earth moving around the sun is 29 kilometers per second.\nCan you imagine how fast this speed is?\nBelieve it or not, it's almost 90 times greater than the speed of sound!\nBut we don't have to worry about feeling dizzy while living on this fast-moving planet.\nThanks to gravity, we're all alive.",

        "5": "《The Deep Sea》\nDeep below the ocean's surface is a mysterious world taking up 95% of the earth's living space.\nThe pressure at the deepest part of the sea (about 10,000 meters below sea level) is about 1,000 times as great as that on the ocean's surface, which is why the deep sea remains largely unexplored.\nHowever, with the development of technologies such as submarines, scientists can now explore this vast area.\nIt's hard to imagine a more forbidding place than the icy cold, dark, and crushing environment of the deep ocean.\nIt's even harder to imagine anything living there.\nBut while exploring the deepest points in the sea, researchers have discovered that thousands of fascinating animals have adapted to life in this challenging environment.\nTaking on many weird forms, animals living in the deep sea look quite alien.\nSome have huge eyes that capture the little existing light.\nOthers seem to be all mouth.\nTheir jaws — often filled with sharp teeth — are always open, ready to capture whatever food falls from above.\nOther deep sea animals have transparent bodies that can be seen through, which enables them to blend into the water.\nWith a variety of advanced technologies, it won't be long before scientists succeed in exploring this vast area that currently remains as mysterious as deep space."

I can't hold on much longer.\nBut why should we both die?\nWouldn't it be better if I at least kept myself alive?\nI wouldn't even have to try too hard to cut the rope.\nOnly a gentle touch would do to cut the rope in this freezing weather...\"\nAnd just like that, Simon cut the rope and could no longer feel Joe's weight.\nSimon survived, but he couldn't feel anything.\nInstinctively, he dug a hole to avoid the cold.\nThe question \"Who killed Joe?\" echoed in his mind.\nPeople were going to blame him for Joe's death.\nThe next day, he descended and saw the crevasse.\nHe called Joe's name only to find himself left with echoes filling the air.\n\"Of course Joe is dead,\" he thought.\nHe kept on walking down with the guilty feeling pressing down on his heart.",

Simon!\"\nJoe noticed someone walking towards him, just as he was passing out, but he couldn't keep himself awake.",

        "3": "At first, my uncle seemed to enjoy being a student again.\nHe was beaming throughout my history class.\nHe thumbed through the textbook, absorbed by some information that he saw there.\nBut by the end of the second class, math, he became more serious.\n\"I wish I'd paid a little more attention to math when I was in school,\" he said, scratching his head.\nIn the third class, Spanish, my uncle's smile started fading and he scribbled a note to me saying, \"I have a terrible headache.\nHow do you say that in Spanish?\"\nI tried to hold back a laugh and patted his arm in encouragement.\nFinally, it was lunch time and we went to the cafeteria.\nMy uncle suddenly exclaimed, \"Why is that girl pointing at me and laughing?\nMaybe she thinks I'm not as smart as I look.\"\nI pulled him away and said, \"Relax, Uncle Bob.\nShe laughs at everybody.\nShe laughed at me once in math class when I had to solve a problem on paper because I couldn't work it out in my head.\"\n\"Oh, I guess that's her personality,\" said my uncle.",
        "4": "Obviously, my uncle was embarrassed at lunch, but he was probably even more embarrassed when he returned to class afterwards.\nThe teacher asked him to name the current Secretary-General of the United Nations and he couldn't think of the answer.\nHorrified, he whispered, \"I should have known that!\nI feel like a fool, especially when everyone is watching me!\"\nAt the end of the school day, my uncle admitted that life as a teen is not as easy as he first thought.\n\"This has been one of the longest and most stressful days I've had,\" he commented and then asked, \"Can I go now?\"\n\"Sure,\" I said to him. \"Thanks for coming, Uncle Bob.\nBy the way, don't forget to do the homework you've been assigned.\"\nMy uncle now sees the resemblance between my life and his ― the stress of having a lot of work to do in a short amount of time, and having to deal with different types of people throughout the day.\nThanks to \"Shadow a Teen for a Day,\" my uncle understands that life as a student is no walk in the park."

        "1": "《PALM OIL, THE BIGGEST THREAT TO ORANGUTANS》\nIt was late evening.\nInto the Orangutan Rescue Center on the island of Borneo rushed a rescue worker holding a tiny bundle in his arms.\nInside, with a face as small as a mouse's, was a 3-month-old orangutan.\nThose who were there that day remember two things about their first meeting with the baby orangutan:\nher big bright eyes, and her left arm, half of which was missing.\n\"Baby orangutans, who ride on their mothers' stomachs by holding onto their long hair, have incredibly strong grips.\nThey do not let go,\" said the director of the Orangutan Rescue Center.\n\"The baby's hand was chopped off, probably to separate her from her mother.\"",
        "2": "Rescuers believe that the baby and her mom had been driven out of their forest home when it was destroyed to make way for a palm oil plantation.\nHungry and weak, the mother was likely walking in the forest in search of food when she encountered some people working there.\nLuckily, the baby orangutan was rescued before more harm was done.\nRescuers named the baby orangutan \"Kesi,\" meaning \"child born in difficult times.\"\nThat name is fitting for many orangutans living in the wild today.\nA hundred years ago, about 230,000 orangutans lived on Earth.\nToday, fewer than 50,000 are left in the wild, living exclusively on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.\nThese islands happen to be ground zero for one of the world's most controversial and rapidly growing industries: palm oil.\nThe cultivation of palm oil is the biggest threat to orangutans.\nAlthough their survival gravely depends on rainforests, people have continuously destroyed rainforests to make room for the production of palm oil.\nDeforestation has reduced the habitat of the orangutans, which in turn has caused thousands of the animals to die.\nAt this rate, orangutans could become extinct in less than 25 years.",
        "3": "So what exactly is palm oil?\nYou may have never heard of palm oil, but you have almost certainly come into contact with it, probably multiple times every day.\nPalm oil is a type of vegetable oil that is derived from the palm fruit.\nIt can be found in thousands of consumer goods, from packaged foods to hair products.\nCheaper and more efficient to produce than other vegetable oils, palm oil is currently used in half of all packaged products.\nThe consumption of palm oil has rapidly increased in the past two decades.\nAlthough the United States and Europe are its top consumers, demand is growing throughout the world.\nRecently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned trans fat in foods, which will likely increase the consumption of palm oil.\nThough by no means healthier, palm oil is set to be the \"clear alternative\" for food producers, experts say.\nThe production of palm oil is the number one cause of forest loss in Indonesia and\nMalaysia. If this continues, the extinction of orangutans will become a sad reality.\nThe future of Kesi's species is in our hands.",
        "4": "《SEOJIN'S GREEN NATURE : Say \"No\" to Palm Oil and Save Orangutans!》\nDid you know that orangutans are one of our closest relatives?\nThe name orangutan is derived from the Indonesian words orang meaning \"person,\" and hutan meaning \"forest.\"\nSo orangutan means \"person of the forest.\"\nThey are so intelligent that they make umbrellas out of leaves when it rains.\nUnfortunately, these smart animals are getting closer to extinction.\nI recently read an article saying that palm oil plantations are destroying the homes of orangutans.\nThe sad thing is that most people are not familiar with palm oil, even though it is in many products that we use on a daily basis.\nThis might surprise you, but palm oil is used in ice cream, cookies, bread, chocolate, soap, and cleaning agents!",
        "5": "So what can we do to help save the orangutans?\nWell, you can talk to your friends and family about palm oil and the dangers orangutans are facing.\nYou could also be an active consumer next time you visit the supermarket.\nRead the labels of products carefully to see if they contain palm oil, and try to avoid them if they do.\nThere is another fun thing you can do to help orangutans: adopt an orangutan!\nI know it sounds impossible, but there are organizations that match you with a baby orangutan when you donate money.\nDon't worry!\nIt doesn't cost a fortune to adopt one; you can start by basically donating a few cents per day.\nEven this small amount will help save the lives of many orangutans.",

        "1": "《IOT: Connecting Everything》\nThere is a car accident near your home while you are sleeping.\nYour phone receives the news and automatically sets your alarm earlier by 20 minutes.\nWhen the alarm rings, the lights turn on to wake you up and the shower self-adjusts the water temperature to your preference.\nWhen you leave the house, all of the machines stop working automatically.\nThis situation may sound like something from a sci-fi movie.\nGuess what?\nThis is one example of what the \"Internet of Things,\" or IoT, can do.\nThe IoT is becoming an increasingly popular topic.\nBut what exactly is the Internet of Things, and how is it changing our lives?",
        "2": "《What is the IoT? How does it work?》\nThe IoT is a network of machines, vehicles, buildings, and other devices that collect data and exchange information using electronics, software, and sensors.\nTo put it simply, we can connect devices over the Internet, letting them talk to each other and to us.\nThe \"things\" in the IoT include everything from smartphones, coffee makers, washing machines, lamps, cars, and entire buildings to almost any other object you can imagine.\nYou might think that the IoT is nothing new.\nWe already interact with machines.\nThere are home heating systems that you can control with your phone while you're away.\nThe IoT takes this interaction to a higher level.\nIt does not require human control, and determines by itself when and how to turn the systems on and off.\nThese home automation systems are able to find your location from your phone's GPS signal.\nThey then determine when to turn themselves off when you leave the house and when to turn themselves on before your arrival.\nA smart fire alarm will not only alert your family in case of a fire, but also notify the local fire and police stations.\nIn such examples, through the IoT, machines exchange data and \"talk\" to each other, making our lives easier, safer and more efficient.",
        "3": "《What is the IoT good for?》\nAt this point, you may wonder why you would want so many devices talking to each other.\nThere are many examples of the IoT's potential value.\nImagine that you have just finished the last bottle of milk from your refrigerator.\nYour fridge notices that there's no milk, so it automatically orders your favorite brand of milk from the store you frequently shop at.\nOr suppose you're meeting your friend outside when your favorite TV show comes on.\nYour TV would automatically start recording the show for you because it knows your preferences and viewing history.\nHow convenient!",
        "4": "While the IoT began with the concept of \"smart homes,\" it is now moving toward the concept of \"smart cities.\"\nOne of the most popular IoT applications is the use of sensors built into the roads to find available parking spaces.\nSearching for parking spots in busy urban areas is frustrating for drivers, intensifies traffic jams, and increases pollution from circling cars.\nSensors built into the roads can tell us how many parking spaces are free, and where they are located.\nBesides providing convenience, the IoT also has large-scale implications for public safety.\nIn 2007, the Interstate 35W bridge in Minnesota collapsed, killing and injuring many people.\nThe collapse was due to steel plates that were incapable of handling the bridge's load.\nNow, when we build bridges, we use smart cement that has sensors that monitor the bridge for cracks or other stresses.\nAlso, these same road sensors could inform your car of driving hazards, such as icy roads, and warn your car to slow down.\nAs such, the IoT makes us aware of problems, helping to prevent accidents and hopefully save countless lives.",
        "5": "《What are the concerns of using the IoT?》\nNothing is perfect in life, and the IoT is no exception.\nWhile there is an endless list of benefits associated with the IoT, there are also serious concerns about security and privacy.\nAll of the devices and systems that make up the IoT collect a great deal of personal data.\nWith an increasing number of home devices being connected over the Internet, what can people do to make sure that their personal information stays secure?\nSomeone might access one device in your home, even just a coffee maker, and be able to gather information about your entire network.\nFor example, someone could use information from an Internet-connected door lock to find out when you enter or leave your home.\nSmart TVs and child monitors could also be used to spy on you.\nWith these concerns in mind, a serious discussion about the benefits and downsides of the IoT is needed.",
        "6": "《What is the future of the IoT?》\nDespite these concerns, the IoT will lead to a new wave of Internet-based products and services.\nThe impact of the IoT will be similar to how smartphones completely changed the world and became a natural part of our daily lives.\nEventually, every device that we use will be connected, and the IoT will be present everywhere.\nThe IoT has already begun to make people's lives more convenient and cities more efficient, and its impact will only continue to grow."

        "2": "《The origin of Hwaseong Fortress》\nThe origin of Hwaseong Fortress goes back to the late Joseon period.\nThis was a time of political instability because various factions fought for power.\nIn the middle of this political conflict, Sadoseja, King Jeongjo's father, was killed when Jeongjo was only 11 years old.\nIt came as a huge shock to young Jeongjo.\nDue to his deep affection for his father, King Jeongjo decided to move his father's tomb from Yangju to Mt. Hwa because it was considered to be an ideal place to build tombs at that time.\nResidents who had been living around the area had to move out, so the king commanded that a new city be built for them, which was Suwon.\nHwaseong Fortress was eventually built to protect Suwon and its residents.\nKing Jeongjo paid frequent visits to the fortress to honor his father, showing how deeply he loved and missed him.\nOne of these visits was on the sixtieth birthday of both of his parents and it was this visit which was illustrated in Banchado.",
        "3": "《Jeongjo's love for the people》\nNot only did he love his father, but King Jeongjo also had a big heart for his people.\nThe way Hwaseong Fortress was designed showed that he really cared for those living in the area.\nThe original design of the fortress was a round-shaped wall.\nHowever, if the fortress had been built as planned, many residents would have ended up living outside the fortress walls.\nThe king learned about the situation and delivered an order, saying:\n\"Even if you have to fold and unfold the fortress walls three times, build the fortress large enough to let all the existing residents live inside the walls.\"\nHe did not want any of the residents to be unprotected.\nThis is why the fortress is shaped like a leaf.\nThere is another story about King Jeongjo's love for his people.\nAt that time, people usually worked on public service projects without getting paid.\nHowever, King Jeongjo instructed the government to pay those who worked on this project.\nAlso, when the weather became too hot while the fortress was being constructed, the king stopped the construction and supplied workers with Cheokseodan, a pill to beat the heat.\nThere is even a document that shows his compassion for his people.\n\"As the weather is extremely hot, I cannot taste food very well, and I am uncomfortable in bed thinking about the workers suffering in this weather.\nSince my sympathy cannot moisten their lungs nor cool their bodies, I am now ordering a special prescription of Cheokseodan and sending the pills to the project site.\nGive them to the workers and let them take the pills with clean water.\"",
        "4": "《A new fortress built with modern science》\nThe construction of Hwaseong Fortress began in 1794 and was completed in 1796, after 33 months of work.\nIts primary architect, Jeong Yakyong, employed the latest building techniques of the time.\nThe fortress wall, which extends for nearly 6 km, was very advanced in that bricks were used in its construction.\nBrick walls have the advantage of withstanding heavy blows and are not easily destroyed, so the fortress was made of both bricks and stones.\nMoreover, holes between the bricks were just big enough to fire guns and arrows through in case of an attack.\nJeong Yakyong also came up with new ways to make construction easier for the workers.\nFor example, he invented a new machine called Geojunggi.\nIt was used to lift and pile up heavy stones with the least amount of energy.\nThis tool greatly reduced construction time.\nWithout it, the construction of the fortress would have taken much longer.",
        "5": "Hwaseong Fortress represents the peak of 18th-century Korean architecture.\nIt is characterized by careful planning and the application of the latest scientific advances.\nIts construction started from King Jeongjo's decision to move his father's tomb, and it has now become a cultural heritage site that attracts visitors from all over the world.\nWe have to be aware of its historical significance and make efforts to preserve its architecture and cultural history.\nIt is now our responsibility to protect this UNESCO World Heritage Site so that our descendants can treasure and enjoy it.\nEvery year in Suwon, a magnificent cultural event takes place to celebrate King Jeongjo's visit to Hwaseong Fortress as depicted in Banchado.\nWhy don't you visit the fortress and feel King Jeongjo's love for his father and the people that he led?"

        "2": "《Human Towers》\nIn the months between spring and autumn, people in Catalonia, Spain build castells during street festivals.\nA castell is a tower of people standing on each other's shoulders, often raised as high as ten levels.\nThe formation of the bottom base or pinya is the first step in building a castell.\nAnybody who is willing to help, from children to senior citizens, can be part of the pinya by supporting the tower and protecting it from collapsing.\nWhen the pinya is formed, each level is added one after another.\nWhen the last person reaches the top and waves his or her hands, the crowd below shouts and cheers.",
        "3": "《Higher, Stronger》\nBuilding a castell means a lot to Catalonians.\nThe knowledge about how to build castells is accumulated over generations and handed down from generation to generation within a community, and can only be learned by practice.\nBuilding one provides people with a strong sense of belonging and a heightened spirit of teamwork and cooperation.\nA castell requires between 75 and 500 people to build, all of whom wear a group color.\nThe color is a proud element of a community, and young children long for the day when they can wear a shirt and play their role in building their group's castell.\nAt a time when individual-based activities dominate most people's leisure time, this Catalan practice does seem to deserve serious attention.",
        "4": "《Gingerbread Craft》\nGingerbread broadly refers to any type of baked treat that is typically flavored with ginger and honey.\nThe process of making a licitar, a type of Croatian gingerbread, is special because it requires skill and endurance.\nThe dough matures for a few days, then is shaped in molds and baked, and then left for two weeks to dry.\nColoring is the next step, after which a second drying takes place.\nOnce dried, the licitars are decorated.\nLicitars are given as gifts for wedding guests, or they can be used as decorations.\nThe custom of giving licitars is deeply rooted in Croatian tradition.\nLicitars are not only a tasty dessert, but they are also an artistic expression.\n《How to Make Licitars》\n1. Prepare dough and let it mature for a few days. Then roll the dough out and shape it in molds.\n2. Bake the shaped dough until it turns light yellow in color.\n3. Put a string between two baked licitars.\n4. Dip the stringed licitars into the glaze and hang them until they dry.\n5. Decorate each licitar with a picture, a mirror, or flowers.",
        "5": "《Secret Family Recipes》\nA licitar is uniquely Croatian because of the long history and the social role it has played.\nCroatians learned the recipe during the 16th century from their neighbors in the eastern Alps and went a step further to develop their own.\nSince then, making licitars has become a family tradition where secrets are passed down from generation to generation.\nIn this way, every generation is able to leave its mark in each gingerbread they make.\nLicitar makers play an important social function, too.\nGingerbread craftspeople appear at most festivals and fairs in Croatia.\nPeople watch cookies being made and socialize.\nIn a time when local cultures are losing their unique identities, Croatian gingerbread craftsmanship provides us with a new perspective on traditional culture.",
        "6": "《Tugging Rituals and Games》\nTugging has long been practiced as a kind of ritual in many agricultural regions across Asia.\nThe way the ritual is performed varies from place to place.\nIn Cambodia, the ritual involves men tugging against women.\nIt takes place during the New Year holidays in April in the open space of a Buddhist temple or a village center.\nIn the Philippines, punnuk is held in the Hapao River, where people tug young trees that are tightly bundled with vines and hooked to a straw figure in the middle.\nIn Vietnam, bamboo poles can be used for tugging.\nIn Korean juldarigi, making a rice straw rope as well as moving it to a ritual site is part of the tradition.\nThe rope stands for a dragon which is believed to bring rain to the region.",
        "7": "《Tug and Pray for a Good Harvest》\nThe tugging rituals in Asia are mostly held by rice farmers, who wish for enough rainfall and abundant harvests, so the rituals can be regarded as a form of prayer in the region.\nThey are also performed as a way of expressing their appreciation for a good harvest.\nThere is no intentional competitive element inherent in the rituals, and winning or losing is not emphasized.\nWhile preparing for the rituals and performing them, participants realize the importance of solidarity, cooperation, and harmony among community members.",

        "3": "The problem for humans is that the harder they hit the ground, the more time they spend in the air, which makes their steps longer but reduces the number of steps they can take.\nTherefore, maximum running speed is attained when the combination of force applied to the ground and stride frequency is optimal.\nUnfortunately, this combination also depends on the runner's size, leg length, and other factors that vary among individuals.\nMany experts predict, however, that a human being could probably run the 100-meter sprint in just over nine seconds.\nMaybe future technology will help runners run even faster than they do today.",

Hurry up!\"\nTwo people with brooms furiously sweep the ice in front of a rock that slides across a sheet of ice.\n\"Whoa!\" The sweepers stop as the rock settles into the house.\n\"Nice job!\" All four players bump fists indicating success.\nHave you guessed the sport?\nIt's called curling.\nOne might expect that a curling stone sliding across the ice would continue in a straight line according to Newton's first law of motion.\nHowever, the stone will begin to curl when it loses its speed even though it is three or four times as heavy as a bowling ball.\nThis is why players have to direct the stone's path carefully, and they do this by sweeping.",
        "5": "By rubbing the ice with the broom, the sweepers are generating heat to reduce friction between the stone and the ice.\nThis results in the stone going straighter and farther.\nIf the sweepers stop, the stone begins to curl again.\nAlthough the house — the area where the curlers aim the stone—is often blocked by an opponent's stone, curling teams can actually guide one stone behind another, which is one of the major strategic elements to the game.\nThe precision with which the team can control the direction and speed of the stone is a major factor in the strategy of the game.",
        "6": "《Why Does a Baseball Have Stitches?》\nThe batter swings and hits a foul ball into the stands.\nYou reach up with your glove and catch it as other spectators clap and cheer.\nYou look at the baseball with its smooth leather covering and bright red stitches.\nDo the stitches serve a purpose other than to keep the leather covering over the ball?\nA typical baseball has 108 double hand stitches.\nThey serve more than just a decorative function.\nThe stitches on a baseball actually affect the flight of the ball.\nWithout them, a pitcher couldn't throw it as fast or as accurately.",
        "7": "When a round object like a ball is thrown, the front part of the ball hits the air, increasing the air pressure there while the air becomes thinner at the back of the ball, making the air pressure low.\nThis difference in air pressure creates an unwanted effect called \"drag\" that literally drags the ball backward and slows it down.\nThis is where the stitches come into play.\nThe stitches more or less scoop the air and direct it inwards towards the back of the ball.\nThis effectively increases the net air pressure in the back of the ball, which reduces the drag.\nFurther, as a baseball is released, the pitcher can put spin on the ball.\nAs the ball spins, the stitches help the ball to fly in the direction the pitcher intends.",
        "8": "《Technology Doping》\nDoping in sports usually involves drugs that players illegally take to gain an unfair advantage in performance.\nAs technology advances, however, doping is done not only with drugs but also with their equipment.\nThat's why the term 'technology doping' was coined, referring to any form of unfair advantage gained from technology by a player or a team.\nIn the 2008 Olympic swimming competitions, when 23 out of 25 world records were set by those in a particular swim suit, investigations concluded that it was a case of technology doping.\nRecently, in a 2016 international cycling event, a cyclist from Belgium was accused of technology doping when a small machine was found inside her bike frame that gave her extra power while she pedaled.\nA specially designed swim suit or a small device in a bicycle clearly gives an unfair advantage.\nThey only discourage athletes who train day and night to improve their performance.\nSuch attempts should be banned in all sports competitions.\nIn order to preserve and promote the core value of fair competition among players, the governing bodies of various sporting events should seek measures to prevent technology doping from entering into their events.\nTechnology has not been developed as an illegal weapon for gaining an unfair advantage.\nIt is to be used as a tool for progress."

        "2": "Mary Seacole was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805.\nHer father was a Scottish soldier, and her mother practiced traditional Jamaican medicine.\nHer mother ran a boarding house while caring for wounded soldiers as if they were her own family members.\nBy observing her mother, Mary learned the practice of traditional Jamaican medicine.\nMary also traveled widely to take care of sick people.\nWhen she visited Panama in 1851, Mary managed to save her first cholera patient, and in so doing she gained extensive knowledge of this disease.\nIn fact, she herself contracted and recovered from it while in Panama.\nHaving overcome many difficulties, she gained a reputation for her work in treating cholera and other diseases.",

        "5": "At the end of the war in 1856, Mary turned out broke.\nShe had spent all her personal wealth in the Crimea.\nShe returned to England ill and poor.\nFortunately, there were veterans who never forgot the amazing things that Mary had done on the battle field.\nSome army officers organized a benefit festival to raise funds in her honor.\nIt was reported that to their surprise, thousands of contributors gathered and her name was shouted by a thousand voices.\nShe was also awarded three medals for her bravery and her work from England, Turkey, and France, which is vividly depicted in her portrait.\nIn 1857, with the help of her supporters, Mary published her autobiography, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands.\nThe last 25 years of her life, however, were spent quietly outside of public attention.\nShe died on May 14th, 1881.",
        "6": "During the Crimean War (1853-1856), Mary Seacole was from time to time compared to Florence Nightingale.\nUnlike Nightingale, Seacole had to overcome prejudice related to her race.\nBeing a born healer, she made her own way to the war where she was needed.\nIn fact, she risked her life to aid the wounded and bring comfort to dying soldiers.\nWhile Florence Nightingale became a legend, Mary Seacole was largely forgotten until the year 2003 when her portrait was accidentally discovered.\nMany people believe that she reappeared in history when a hero like her was needed most.",
        "7": "《The Crimean War and Inventions》\nMany inventions have been made during wartime.\nSome came about accidentally while others were developed as solutions to particular military problems.\nThe Crimean War was no exception.\nThe three-year war brought about some important inventions that are still in use today.\nThe weather was bitterly cold and damp during the Crimean War.\nSo Lord Cardigan, a commander of the British forces, began wearing a woolen sweater with buttons down the front to keep warm.\nThus the original cardigan sweater was born.\nAnother invention at that time was the trench coat.\nIn the beginning of the Crimean War, soldiers wore wool coats to keep warm in the bitter cold.\nTo their disappointment, however, the wool coats would get soaked and become heavy in the rain.\nSoon water-resistant trench coats began to replace the old ones.\nModern weather forecasting also got its start during that war.\nAfter British and French ships were destroyed during a storm on the Black Sea, the French government investigated the circumstances leading to the disaster and found that the storm could have been predicted.\nThis encouraged the governments of France and Britain to start a weather forecasting service.\nWithout doubt, all three cases are good examples of the old saying, \"necessity is the mother of invention.\""

        "3": "《From Land to the Ocean》\nAs more people want more meat, it is inevitable that land for livestock be extended to meet the demand.\nMore meat production results in increased water pollution in both rivers and oceans since cows and pigs eat a lot and at the same time produce a lot of manure.\nLivestock is said to produce 130 times as much manure as humans in the U.S.\nWhen not managed properly, the manure and water containing it cause severe harm to the ecosystems of rivers and oceans.\nWhen rain comes, manure is washed away with the runoff, polluting nearby soil, streams, and rivers all the way until it reaches the ocean.",

I really miss the good old days when beef was reasonably priced,\" says Mom.\n\"Why is beef so expensive?\" asks Josh with a puzzled look.\n\"Raising cows is costly because global warming has resulted in a lack of natural resources,\" Dad explains.\n\"I can't imagine the old days when people ate beef as often as we eat insects today.\nBut Why complain?

It's amazing to see their energy and passion.\nJoining the project, they break stereotypes and take on new challenges.\nI'm so proud that I can contribute to this.\nReporter: What do you think you've learned through all of this?\nAvani: I've lived in this city all my life, and somehow I just assumed that the world I was living in was all there was in India.\nEven though I would see the slums on my way to school, I never looked into them that much.\nThings look different, however, when I care about people in need and try to come up with solutions for them.",
        "4": "Reporter: Why do you think it's important to empower women and young girls?\nAvani: We're getting them to realize their potential and to realize they can do something big with their lives.\nOur project is a really small step if you look at it from a worldly perspective.\nBut I think something small like this can help inspire a young generation to make a difference.\nReporter: What's one thing you know that you wish everybody knew?\nAvani: I believe there really is something you can do to help people.\nDon't just think, \"I feel really bad, but what can I do?\"\nThere's something big out there ― or even something small ― that everyone can do.\nHow do you feel about Avani?\nTruly, she believes that everyone in the world could take initiative to improve society.\nAs our world becomes smaller and global problems become bigger, we need difference-makers now more than ever.\nDon't forget that Avani is just your age.\nYou are never too young to start making a difference."

        "3": "When Rousseau first showed four paintings at the Salon exhibition in 1886, people did not respond favorably to them.\nThe public and critics laughed at Rousseau's flat, seemingly childish style of portraying human figures.\nThis was because the paintings did not look real.\nRousseau's style was markedly different from the contemporary mainstream.\nOne critic even said, \"Monsieur Rousseau paints with his feet with a blindfold over his eyes.\"\nIn spite of such harsh criticism, Rousseau never gave up his style.\nHe continued to draw his paintings and submit them to the Salon.",
        "4": "It was around the turn of the 20th century that Rousseau's paintings began to attract some young artists.\nThey were bored with existing painting styles and Rousseau's paintings met their desire for a new trend.\nEspecially, Pablo Picasso admired the strange energy of Rousseau's paintings because they looked unfamiliar and mysterious.",

        "1": "《The Art of Preserving Travel Memories》\nOne of the best things that travel gives us is the memories of the places we've visited and the special experiences we had there.\nIn order to hold on to these precious memories, we often bring home souvenirs.\nThese souvenirs tend to be objects like postcards, fridge magnets, and key chains.\nHowever, a souvenir doesn't have to be something purchased in a gift shop.\nIn fact, the word souvenir means \"memory\" in French, so whatever brings back memories could be called a \"souvenir.\"\nThen what can we keep as souvenirs to preserve our travel memories other than ordinary gift shop products?\nLet's look into what other travelers do to make their travel memories last longer.",
        "2": "《Matthew (24, UK): Make a Plate with Your Travel Maps》\nBuying souvenirs and taking photos can be good ways to remember a trip, but most of the time I would store these things somewhere and hardly ever look at them, and thus they would be slowly forgotten.\nSo I came up with my own method of preserving memories in a more interesting and visible way.\nI started doing this two years ago when I got an opportunity to travel around Europe with one of my best friends.\nIt was a spontaneous trip, so we relied mainly on paper maps from hostels or tourist information offices.\nEvery day, we planned our route and sightseeing stops on those maps.\nWhen I returned home, I realized I had accumulated lots of these maps, and suddenly I thought I could make a souvenir out of them.\nI began by cutting out some landmarks from the map that showed the best parts of our trip, such as the Eiffel Tower, St. Peter's Basilica, and the Colosseum.\nThen I got an ordinary plate and pasted the map pieces onto it using special glue.\nFinally, I put a layer of sealant over the whole plate so that the paper wouldn't fade or wear out over time.\nThe result is a wonderful decoration that I can look at every day.\nIt is also a terrific reminder of every place I visited.",
        "3": "《Sarah (56, USA): Keep Charms on a Bracelet》\nShortly after my wedding 30 years ago, I went on a road trip with my husband.\nWe started in New York City and drove across the entire country to San Francisco.\nThere, at a tiny souvenir shop, my husband found a bracelet charm in the shape of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nWhen I saw this cute little charm, I thought it would be a great souvenir to remember the trip, so I bought it to hang on my silver bracelet.\nThis turned out to be the beginning of a lifelong tradition.\nAfter a few months, my husband and I got a chance to travel to Moscow.\nThere, we happened to find a tiny St. Basil's Cathedral charm and it reminded me of the first charm from San Francisco.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, we bought it to add to the bracelet.\nSince then, we have managed to find the perfect charm on every trip.\nWe now have nearly 20 different charms — one from each trip.\nWe have a Taj Mahal charm from India, a Parthenon charm from Greece, and even an elephant charm from Kenya.\nAs my children grew up, they helped choose some of the charms, so our whole family can look back at every trip we've taken together.",
        "4": "《Aamir (32, India): Save Your SIM Cards and Hotspots》\nWhether it's for uploading status messages and selfies on social networks or for looking up the best restaurants, staying connected online is not an option but a must for many travelers these days.\nHowever, finding an affordable way to get a reliable connection when traveling overseas can be very challenging.\nSo I buy a SIM card when I get to a foreign country.\nAt a reasonable price I can get the same connection speed as the locals.\nThat's not all.\nBecause countries all have different telecommunication companies, each SIM card is a unique souvenir of my trip to that country.\nWhat's more, as SIM cards don't take up luggage space, they're very easy to take home.\nI have a collection of nine already, and it's growing fast!",
        "5": "Another thing I collect might sound strange: Wi-Fi hotspots.\nWhenever I'm in a place I want to remember, I purposely connect to the Wi-Fi.\nThen, the hotspot name is automatically stored on my phone from that time on!\nOccasionally I glance through the list of all the museums, resorts, restaurants, and other places I've visited in my travels.\nAlthough I can't connect to these hotspots when I get home, just catching a glimpse of one of their names on the list makes me excited.\nAll the memories from that place come flooding into my mind, and I can remember exactly what it was like to be, for example, at that peaceful terrace near the shore in Bali.\nFor a moment, it's almost like I'm actually there!",
        "6": "《Hyojeong (18, Korea): Make Friends and Keep in Touch》\nFor me, the best souvenirs are new friends I make while traveling.\nObviously, I can't put the people in my suitcase to take them home, but while we're together, I can have conversations and laugh with them.\nSometimes I add them on social media or ask for their contact information so that I can stay in touch with them.\nTwo years ago I made friends with an elderly couple from Japan I met at the Jeonju Hanok Village.\nWhile in the restroom, I happened upon a woman's bag.\nRight away, I took it to a nearby police station.\nWhen I got there, I met an elderly couple who had come there looking for their lost bag.\nHappily, the woman was the owner of the bag that I had found, so I handed it to them.\nThey were so thankful that they treated me to dinner, and we had a great time together.\nWe still keep in touch, and last year they even visited my home in Gyeongju.\nFor me, this proves that a good relationship is the best souvenir, because it can make the memories of a trip last for a long time.",
        "7": "《Save Precious Memories with Your Own Souvenirs》\nIn the end, travel is really about personal memories and unique experiences that will color your soul and enrich your life.\nSo the next time you think about grabbing a souvenir as a reminder of your trip, remember: whatever captures your own priceless moments will be better than any souvenir you can easily buy with money."

        "1": "《Experiencing the Golden Years》\nTry as we might, we cannot stay young forever.\nAlthough this is a truth everyone knows, the thought of becoming old is usually the furthest thing from our minds.\nThat's why we rarely pay attention to the physical changes that make everyday life challenging for the elderly or the financial difficulties they may experience after retirement.\nMany of us consider these problems irrelevant to our lives, so we have little understanding of what it means to be old.\nIn order to understand the elderly more, 27-year-old Regina Martin and 34-year-old Trent Bowman decided to participate in a TV documentary called Switching Ages.\nFor one month, they transformed themselves into old people.\nIn addition to learning how to walk and talk like people in their seventies, Regina and Trent also spent five hours every morning putting on make-up to look older.\nThey even wore heavy body suits and contact lenses that hindered their movements and eyesight.\nFinally, they wore fake teeth and gray wigs to complete their aged looks.\nTheir amazing disguises, however, were only the tip of the iceberg of the transformation they would experience.",
        "2": "《Regina's Story》\nRegina Martin has been a passionate dance instructor for the past three years.\nAlthough she is still a few years away from turning 30, Regina is starting to feel even more pressure to retain her looks.\nShe obsessively takes care of her body and always eats healthy food.\nShe has a strong fear of her youth disappearing and feels uncomfortable around old people, to the point where she is unwilling to visit her 81-year-old grandmother.\nOn the first day of her challenge, Regina could only stare at her transformed self in disbelief.\nAfter a few minutes, Regina sighed and said, \"This wrinkled face doesn't look nice.\"\nLater Regina was sent to a tiny flat in a retirement complex, where she spent several days enduring solitude and gradually adapted to living alone.",
        "3": "As part of the experiment, Regina worked at a grocery store that many elderly people visit.\nThinking that they would be boring and stuffy, she was reluctant to have conversations with them at first.\nHowever, she soon found it very enjoyable to talk with them.\nShe met older people who still enjoyed bike riding and others who liked playing video games.\nAt her retirement complex, Regina joined a companionship group, and she was surprised to find that older people could still fall in love and suffer from broken hearts.\nHer new friendships continued to grow stronger over the next couple of weeks, and she began to feel as if she were their peer.",
        "4": "As time went on, Regina started feeling guilty for deceiving them.\nShe decided to come clean about her real age to her two closest elderly friends, Susan and Charlotte, a week before the challenge was over.\nShe worried that they might feel betrayed after her confession, but they just laughed it off and shared some life tips with her to help her enjoy her youth more.\nAt the end of the experiment, Regina said, \"I don't look at the elderly in the same way that I used to anymore.\nI have realized how ignorant I was.\nI couldn't see that old people are just like me.\nNow I can look past their gray hair and wrinkles and see the young people inside them.\nInstead of worrying about my looks fading, I'm now fully embracing the idea of growing old.\"",
        "5": "《Trent's Story》\nBefore participating in this documentary, Trent had had very little interaction with elderly people except for his 77-year-old grandfather.\nHe enjoyed his day-to-day life without worry and thought it quite satisfying to live in his parents' house.\nDuring the weekdays, Trent would spend his time working part-time at a restaurant.\nOn the weekends, he would play basketball or go shopping with his friends.\nIn short, Trent had little ambition and little money saved up for the future, but he didn't care.\nAs he only lived in the present, Trent never thought about getting old.\nHe just regarded the elderly as a strange tribe that he would never join.\nSpending a month fully disguised as a 72-year-old man was much more life-changing than Trent could have ever imagined.\nHe could finally see for himself what it was like to live as a senior citizen in society.",
        "6": "Early in the experiment, Trent tried to get on a bus to go downtown.\nDue to the special body suit and lenses, he had trouble climbing up the stairs of the bus.\nThen a person waiting behind him started rushing him, expressing annoyance.\nIn his hurry to step onto the bus, Trent almost fell on the stairs.\nHe was astonished to see the disrespectful attitude toward old people and the way they were treated.\nLater he visited the restaurant where he once worked, but he noticed that no one paid much attention to him.\nPeople acted as if he weren't there.\nTrent started to realize what it felt like to be invisible.\nHowever, there were some brighter moments that helped Trent have a more cheerful view of growing older.\nWhen Trent took a short trip to Colombia, he encountered a delightful older couple — Andre, 78, and Eunice, 76 — who were there to learn salsa dancing.\nWhile having a conversation with them, Trent was impressed by the fact that they were still healthy and content with their lives.\nThe passion they still had for life inspired Trent to start making some huge changes in his life.",
        "7": "\"I realized life was too short to just sit around and wait for things to happen to me,\" he said.\nNow that Trent knows how important it is to plan and save for the future, he has decided to find a more stable job and move out of his parents' house.\nTrent has also started to exercise regularly so that he can stay healthy and fully enjoy his golden years in the future.\nLiving as an older person was a hard experience for both Regina and Trent, but they consider it an invaluable one.\nThis once-in-a-lifetime opportunity helped them understand not only the physical changes that older people go through but also the way society treats them.\nBy walking in someone else's shoes, Regina and Trent were able to see that the elderly also enjoy life with passion.\nMoreover, the experience changed the way they conduct their lives.\nThey hope that this documentary will help raise awareness of the problems the elderly continue to face and help young people have a more positive view of growing older."

        "1": "《Tricks behind Statistics》\nIn today's world, there is a lot of statistical information around us all the time.\nEvery time we read an article on the Internet or see a commercial on TV, we are likely to come into contact with numbers and figures.\nGenerally, these numbers help us make better decisions in our daily lives.\nFor example, when we choose which movie to see, we can check the ratings and see the reviews of thousands of viewers.\nSimilarly, when people see statistics that show fastening a seat belt greatly increases the chances of surviving a car accident, they may choose to wear one themselves.\nThese are just a few examples of how statistical information plays an important role in our lives.\nHowever, is it safe to believe statistics exactly the way they are presented to us?\nUnfortunately, statistics can be misused in many ways.\nLet's learn about some common tricks behind statistics.",
        "2": "《Samples: How Many and Who?》\nOn the Internet, Minjeong sees an advertisement that reads, \"100% of users report brighter and softer skin with Blossom Company's liquid facial soap.\"\nIt claims that these results are from an independent laboratory and are guaranteed by a public agency.\nMinjeong does not question the statistics and buys some bottles, despite the high price.\nHowever, although Minjeong uses the soap for a few months, she does not experience any noticeable changes.\nDid Minjeong just happen to buy a defective product?\nOr was the advertisement completely fake?\nWhen Minjeong read \"100% of users,\" she should have asked herself, \"Where did the company get this figure?\"\nIf Minjeong had read the tiny letters at the bottom of the ad, she would have found that the sample included only five people.\nAs in this case, when a sample is not large enough to show a wide range of results, it can be misleading.\nBy using small samples, companies can come up with any results they want and use them for their own purposes.",
        "3": "People can also get the wrong idea from statistics when a sample is not random.\nFor example, a restaurant may put survey cards on the tables, hoping to know what most customers think about its food, service, or atmosphere.\nHowever, few cards will be filled out by normal customers, because they don't have any reason to do so.\nOnly those with strongly positive or negative reactions are likely to respond to the survey.\nThis method of choosing a sample is called \"voluntary response sampling.\"\nSuch samples are biased in favor of strong opinions and underrepresent the moderate ones.\nTherefore, when you see a statistic, remember that the sample is just as important as the statistic itself.\nHow many people were in the sample? Who were they?\nIf you don't know, be careful not to leap to conclusions.",
        "4": "《The Trap of Averages》\nABC Corporation wants to hire some employees.\nIn order to look like a well-paying company and to recruit competent candidates, the company decides to distribute a press release that says the average yearly salary of its employees is $57,000, which is quite high.\nHowever, the fact is that more than half of its employees earn no more than $30,000 or less a year, and the most common salary for employees is only $20,000.\nDid the company spread false information? How is this possible?\nIt's because the company used the trap of averages.\nAverages can show different pictures depending on which type is chosen.\nTo understand the meaning of different types of averages, let's look at the illustration on the next page.",
        "5": "Most often, the term \"average\" indicates the \"mean.\"\nIt is calculated by adding all the values in a group and dividing the result by the number of group members.\nHowever, the mean is not the only kind of average.\nThere are two more kinds: the \"median\" and the \"mode.\"\nThe median is the number that is exactly in the middle of all the other figures.\nIn this case it is $30,000, because 12 employees are making more than $30,000 and 12 are making less.\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently — $20,000 in this case.\nAs you can see in the illustration, there's only a handful of people that are earning an average salary of $57,000 or higher.\nHowever, because the company wanted to be perceived as a well-paying one, it used the mean, which results in a deceptively high average salary.\nAn average is convincing because it is so simple.\nTo avoid being tricked, however, you have to know what sort of average is being reported.\nYou also need to find out the distribution of the values in order to get a more accurate idea of the real data.",
        "6": "《Same Data, Different Graphs》\nIn mass media, graphs are often used because they display data more efficiently than tables of raw data do.\nHowever, graphs can be misleading, too.\nLet's look at the two graphs below.\nThe two graphs shown here illustrate how data can be misrepresented.\nIn the first graph, the vertical axis goes all the way up to 100 and all the way down to 0, which makes the decrease in the percentage look modest.\nIn the other graph, only 10 percentage points are shown, from 65 to 75, which makes the change seem much more extreme.\nNotable is the fact that the two graphs are based on exactly the same data.\nSo, if you want to point out the seriousness of skipping breakfast, you can use the second graph.\nIn fact, you can make nearly any graph more convincing in favor of your argument by cutting off the graph at a certain point.\nHence, whenever you see a graph, you should check the units on the vertical and horizontal axes to see what the highest and lowest values are.\nDon't simply assume the visual impact is the same as the real story.\nCheck whether the graph is presented in a specific way to emphasize a point.",
        "7": "《Look with a Critical Eye》\nWhen people state opinions in articles, speeches, debates, or advertisements, they often give some statistics to support or reinforce their point.\nIf these statistics are found through proper research methods, then they are objective facts.\nHowever, many statistics that you see and hear could just be numbers that are meant to convince you of a certain view.\nTherefore, the next time you come across some statistics, don't blindly accept any data that is presented.\nLook at the statistics in detail with a critical eye, and then judge whether or not they are convincing."

        "1": "《A Passion for Science and Art》\nToday, it is common knowledge that butterflies go through an egg-caterpillar-pupa cycle.\nHowever, until the 17th century, many people regarded the butterfly and the caterpillar as entirely different creatures.\nThey believed insects were evil creatures that came from mud.\nButterflies, on the other hand, were considered \"summer birds,\" and it was commonly believed that they just fell from the sky in warm weather and vanished in the fall.\nIn those days, one woman stood out as a pioneer.\nAlthough having an interest in insects was considered odd and weird, she observed many cases of insect metamorphosis and recorded these invaluable scientific observations through her unique paintings.\nHer name was Maria Sibylla Merian.",
        "2": "Merian was born in 1647 in the city of Frankfurt, Germany.\nWhen she was still little, she became very interested in painting flowers.\nIt is said that she once climbed over a wealthy neighbor's wall to find flowers that she could paint.\nShe took some tulips without the owner's permission.\nShe must have been unaware of how expensive they were at the time.\nWhen little Maria confessed her act, the neighbor asked to see the painting.\nSeeing her painting, he was so impressed that he only asked for the painting as compensation.\nWhen she was 13, Merian began to develop a keen interest in bugs.\nIt was unusual for a young girl to be passionate about caterpillars, spiders, and other insects, but Merian was obsessed to the point that she would sometimes watch them for weeks on end.\nShe carefully painted each step of their life cycles, depicting even subtle changes.",
        "3": "Even after Merian got married and had children, her passion for insects did not die down.\nShe kept caterpillars and butterflies at home in order to study and paint them.\nTo capture each moment of change, she spent many nights awake, watching and waiting.\nIn her house were so many plants and jars of insects that her kitchen began to look more like a research lab.\nAfter almost 20 years of hard work, Merian published a book about insects in 1679.\nThere had already been books about insects, but Merian's was special.\nWhile no other books had ever depicted the full life cycle of insects, Merian's showed each stage of metamorphosis in detail.\nIn addition, Merian revealed the relationships between living things by illustrating insects within their natural surroundings.\nThis was different from other drawings of the time, which displayed only single specimens on a plain background.\nIn an era when most scientists perceived plants and animals individually, Merian paid attention to how they fit together.",
        "4": "Many years passed and Merian moved to Amsterdam, where she was able to sell her paintings and view marvelous and exotic butterfly specimens that other enthusiasts had collected.\nHowever, seeing these lifeless creatures stuck in cases only made Merian desire to see them in their real habitat.\nFinally, in June 1699, at 52 years of age, Merian and her youngest daughter got on a ship headed for Surinam, a territory belonging to the Netherlands in South America.\nThis was a bold challenge.\nIn addition to being a female naturalist in the male-dominated world of 17th-century science, Merian was also setting out on an expedition with purely scientific goals before it became common.",
        "5": "She spent about two years in Surinam, exploring the rainforests.\nConfronted with intense heat, fierce tropical storms, and dangerous animals such as tarantulas and flesh-eating fish, Merian continued to collect every sample she could get.\nIn her own house, she kept the insects she brought out of the forests and made numerous descriptions and paintings.\nEventually she painted more than 90 species of insects and at least 60 species of plants.\nWith these paintings she published her life's work, Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam, in 1705.\nThe book showed Merian's passion for both insects and painting.\nIt was a truly remarkable book for its time, which contained colorful and detailed paintings of butterflies, bees, spiders, frogs, and even snakes.",
        "6": "One illustration shows a bright blue butterfly flying over the colorful flowers of a pomegranate plant, with another butterfly sitting nearby and a caterpillar creeping down the flower stem.\nAnother depicts two spider webs stretched between tree branches, with tarantulas and ants attacking their prey.\nWhen the book was published, it had a tremendous influence on the scientific understanding of insects at the time.\nSome scientists even used her illustrations in the classification of species.\nHer work also brought new life not just to insect study but to the art world.\nGoethe, a celebrated German poet, also must have been impressed by her work.\nHe praised Merian's talent for weaving art and science together.\nIn spite of this success, the popularity of her work faded after her death.\nIt is thought that this was because she was not a professional researcher and had no formal education.\nFurthermore, her work dealt with flowers and insects, not the historical or religious topics that prevailed in those days.",
        "7": "In the 20th century, however, Maria Sibylla Merian's work was reevaluated.\nHistorians and artists began to recognize her extraordinary accomplishments and her passion that contributed so much to early modern science.\nIn recognition of her achievement, Germany put her portrait on their 500-mark bill, and today many schools there are named after her.\nMaria Sibylla Merian was a naturalist whose passion for plants and insects left its mark on the science world.\nWhile other scientists of the day were debating whether or not insects grew out of mud, she demonstrated the stages of metamorphosis.\nTo the art world, Merian was one of the first to show the artistic power of nature.\nDespite the doubts, suspicion, and ridicule she faced for being so different from \"typical\" women, Merian is now known as one of the greatest scientific illustrators in history."

        "2": "The IoT is a network of objects that exchange and act upon data collected by sensors and software they have.\nIn this system, everyday objects — not only traditional electronic devices but also things like food packaging and clothing — can interact with one another.\nRight now many things are connected to the Internet, but they have to be manipulated by humans in order for information to be exchanged.\nWith the IoT, however, things connected to the Internet will be communicating with one another without human intervention.\nThis system will boost efficiency by saving us time, money, and effort.\nSome reports expect the number of connected devices to reach 1 trillion in 2025.\nHowever, we don't have to wait until then to see the effect of the IoT on our lives.",
        "3": "《Smart Home》\nSmart homes are houses equipped with devices that operate automatically or can be controlled remotely.\nThese devices make life more convenient.\nFor those who want to wake up without noisy music, installing smart blinds might be the answer.\nThese blinds slowly open in the morning to let the sun naturally wake you up.\nIn addition, they can regulate your home's temperature by controlling the amount of sunlight allowed in.\nAnother helpful smart device is the smart refrigerator.\nGone are the days when you ran out of milk or eggs.\nThis refrigerator will keep track of all the items it contains and text you to get what you need the next time you go shopping.\nIt will also remember the expiration dates of all the items inside it, so you won't have to worry about having spoiled food.",
        "4": "The IoT and smart-home sensors can also protect your home from damage.\nFor example, placing moisture-detection sensors around things that might leak water, such as sinks, boilers and drains, will save you a lot of future trouble.\nIf the sensors detect any leaks, they will quickly notify you so that you can stop the leaks and prevent them from becoming bigger problems.\nFurthermore, with a smart security system, you can enjoy a new sense of certainty and control from anywhere at any time.\nNot only can this security system alert you and the police of a break-in, but it can also allow you to use your phone to monitor your home remotely.",

        "7": "As we speak, conversations about the impact of the IoT are taking place all over the world.\nWithout a doubt, advancements in the IoT will make life much easier.\nHowever, we should be careful not to get overly optimistic.\nThere are also some negative aspects that we should consider, such as potential issues with privacy and security.\nIf we brush these issues aside, it is easy for our trust in IoT devices to be abused.\nTherefore, it is important to understand the opportunities and challenges we will face as we build more and more things to be a part of the IoT.\nAfter all, we, not our devices, should be the ones shaping our future."

        "2": "A whole new start for the city was once a popular solution.\nA lot of run-down urban areas were entirely wiped out in favor of massive redevelopment that would meet the demands of the modern city, for housing, transport, office or commercial space.\nOld buildings were torn down and were soon replaced with bright, shining buildings.\nThis approach to urban renewal may have been fast, effective, and profitable, but the true cost was ignored.\nThe historical traces of the cityscape were forever erased, and residents with limited means were driven from their homes in the newly redeveloped neighborhoods.\nBecause of this disregard for the human aspect, new perspectives to look at urban renewal are being brought into focus ― more creative, more community-friendly and better at preserving a city's architectural heritage.",
        "3": "《Escalators Transform Life in Hillside Neighborhood》\nA couple of decades ago, Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, was suffering from violence and poverty.\nToday the colorful city is part of an altogether brighter picture, a rising metropolitan economy in Latin America.\nThis remarkable redevelopment is the result of inventive city planning.\nComuna 13, a community high up on the city's hillside, was once a shelter for armed criminals.\nSteep roads climbing as high as 28 stories of stairs made it impossible for vehicles to access this poor neighborhood, leaving the community isolated, abandoned by law enforcement.\nThe city came up with a clever idea to secure access to the area ― a 384-meter long series of escalators that scales the mountain.\nFreely open to the public, the journey takes a total of only six minutes.\nThe residents cannot speak highly enough of the simple innovation.\nIt has brought peace, pride, and prosperity to a community that had long suffered from governmental abandonment and unchecked crime of all sorts.\nIn recent years Medellin's crime rate has fallen by more than 80 percent from its peak and the city has become a global model for successful transformation.\nThe escalators themselves have become famous; they are now a symbol of rebirth and have encouraged international corporations to open new facilities in the area.\nMedellin's renewal has attracted planners from cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Johannesburg, and Washington, D.C. to see how it was accomplished.",

        "7": "《Upcycling and Adaptive Reuse》\nUpcycling is the process through which waste materials or useless products are transformed into new materials or products with a higher value, leading to a reduction in production and consumption.\nThe term was initially used in 1994 by the German engineer Reiner Pilz, but in recent years has become widely used.\nIn 2013, architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart released a book The Upcycle, which cited upcycling as a practical way to improve the world.\nIn architecture, a major form of upcycling is adaptive reuse.\nAdaptive reuse refers to the process of reusing an old site or building for a purpose different from its original one.\nAdaptive reuse deals with the issues of conservation and development and tries to reach a balance between the two, thus it becomes an effective way to reduce urban sprawl and environmental impact.\nBy reusing an existing structure within a site, the energy and resources required to create these spaces are significantly lessened, with the added advantage of preserving architectural history.\nThere are many prominent examples of adaptive reuse around the globe.\nFor a representative example, the Bankside Power Station in London was converted for use as the Tate Modern, a modern branch of the Tate Art Gallery.\nThe once dark brick structure is now a symbol of rebirth, helping rebuild the old neighborhood of Southwark.\nThe Tate Modern is estimated to have created 2,400 jobs and generated at least $80 million annual income for London."

        "1": "《Miracle on the Hudson》\nWhen US Airways Flight 1549 landed on New York's Hudson River on a cold winter's day, what seemed destined to be a tragedy became an extraordinary tale of success and survival.\nAfter all 155 people were pulled from the icy waters by rescue boats, a story of a miracle began to emerge.\nIt was a miracle created with the coordinated efforts of a highly trained pilot, flight attendants, ferry operators and rescue workers.\nOn January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 took off from LaGuardia Airport in New York City, heading toward Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIt was a normal takeoff in every regard.\nAbout 90 seconds after the takeoff, however, Captain Chesley Sullenberger noticed large birds covering the cockpit windows, from top to bottom, from left to right, and they were too close to avoid.\nThe next moment, the birds hit the engines of the plane.\n\"It felt like the airplane was being hit by heavy rain,\" Sullenberger later recalled.\n\"I felt the engine shaking, and burned bird smell was being brought into the airplane.\"",
        "2": "The airplane was about 3,000 feet over New York City when the engines failed, and the aircraft started to descend rapidly.\nCaptain Sullenberger urgently looked for some place to land and contacted air traffic control.\nThe idea of turning back to LaGuardia was quickly dismissed because the distance and altitude required for the return could not be maintained.\nIf he had turned his plane back to LaGuardia, it would have made the emergency landing disastrous for everyone on board and people on the ground.\nAnd then the Hudson River came into sight on his left.\n\"The only smooth level place sufficiently large enough to land an airplane this size is the river,\" Sullenberger thought.\nThat decision to go on the Hudson was made just one minute after the birds had hit.\nSullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles prepared to land on the water.",
        "3": "A water landing is never an easy job, one that only a few airline pilots have ever accomplished safely.\nIn addition, Sullenberger had just three and half minutes to make it happen.\nHe recalled an airplane that landed in the Indian Ocean in 1996 and broke into pieces, killing most of the passengers on board.\nHe was determined to avoid such a disaster.\nTo do so, he needed to touch down with the wings exactly level, with the nose slightly up, and at a speed that was survivable, just above the minimum flying speed but not below it.\nMost importantly, he needed to make all these things happen simultaneously.\nNinety seconds before hitting the water, Captain Sullenberger made an announcement to the passengers and the crew.\nThree simple words: \"Brace for impact.\"\nWith Captain Sullenberger busy making the complex calculations needed for the emergency water landing, panic spread among the passengers.\nDoreen Welsh, one of the three flight attendants, got out of her seat and calmed everyone down.\nShe said, \"It's okay. We might have lost one engine. We'll circle around.\"\nAs soon as the Captain made the announcement, the flight attendants began yelling, \"Brace, brace, heads down, stay down! Brace, brace, heads down, stay down!\"",
        "4": "Sullenberger landed his plane between two ferry terminals so ferries and boats quickly came to the rescue.\nDespite his superb control of the plane, the impact was so powerful that it tore a hole under the airplane's tail.\nWater began to pour into the cabin.\nSeeing that the water level was lower than the emergency exit door, Sheila Dail, one of the flight attendants, opened the door and the chute automatically came out and inflated.\nAt the command of Captain Sullenberger to evacuate, passengers started to get out.\nAs the three flight attendants worked to calm down the panicked passengers during the evacuation, one of the passengers just kept looking at Dail with a very anxious face.\nShe tried to comfort him, saying, \"Be calm, and just try to breathe.\"",
        "5": "The man later told Dail that he could not tell her how frightened he was at the moment and how comforting it was to have someone looking at him and telling him that everything was going to be fine.\nIt turned out that he had lost his brother, a firefighter, in 9/11.\nDuring the evacuation, he was thinking that his family would not survive another loss in the family.\nWithin minutes after the landing, three New York Waterway ferries approached the airplane.\nScared passengers began to get out of the emergency exits into the brutally cold air and onto the wings of the plane, which was taking on water.\nThe first ferry pulled up alongside the plane and some passengers leaped onto the decks while others were helped aboard by ferry crew.\nSoon, police boats, Coast Guard craft and many other boats covered the scene.\nHelicopters brought police divers, who dropped into the water to help with the rescue.\nWhen the crew had cleared out all the passengers, Captain Sullenberger walked up and down the cabin twice to make sure everyone was out.\nThen he took a final look at his sinking plane and got on the last life raft, now filled with passengers.\nThe lives of all 155 people on board were saved, with only two people seriously injured.",
        "6": "Captain Sullenberger received thousands of letters after the accident.\nHis wife Lorrie's favorite one read: \"Dearest Captain Sullenberger. Big Apple hero.\nYesterday I received a message from my 84-year-old father who lives on the 30th floor of a building with river views here in Manhattan.\nMy father could have passed away along with your other passengers, if you had not landed in the river.\nAs a Holocaust survivor, my father taught me that to save a life is to save a world as you never know what the person you've saved will go on to contribute to the peace and healing of the world.\"\nThe final report by the National Transportation Safety Board on the accident credited the outcome to four factors.\nThe first one was a good decision by the pilots.\nThe second one was the fact that the plane carried life vests and additional rafts and slides, even though they were not required for that route, making it suitable for an extended overwater operation.\nThe third one was the performance of the flight crew during the evacuation.\nAnd the last one was the closeness of working boats to the landing site, which was crucial for a fast response from the ferry operators and emergency workers.",
        "7": "《A Bird Strike》\nThe event of a bird hitting an airplane in flight is referred to as a bird strike.\nBird strikes usually occur when an airplane is flying at a low altitude, such as during takeoffs or landings because that is where most birds fly.\nMost airports adopt a system to scatter birds away, including \"bird cannons\" or bird alarms.\nIn the spring and the fall, when many birds migrate, they set off bird alarms quite often, about twice an hour, from early in the morning till late in the evening.\nIn the summer and the winter, the alarms are set off a couple of times a day.\nWhat would happen if a bird were to hit an airplane in flight?\nThe majority of bird strikes do little damage to the aircraft, although these clashes are almost always fatal to the birds involved.\nThe most dangerous conditions arise when birds hit the jet engines of an airplane.\nThe birds in the engine can slow down or block the motion of the fan blades, resulting in its partial or complete failure.\nYou may wonder how objects as small as birds can cause great damage to such a large and hard object as an airplane.\nIt all depends on the speed of the plane.\nConsider a 5-kilogram bird hitting an airplane flying at a speed of 275 kilometers per hour.\nThat impact is equal to the energy of a 100-kilogram bag being dropped from a height of 15 meters.\nImagine what it would feel like to be hit by a bag weighing 100 kilograms from that height."

        "1": "《Why We Cry》\nCrying is a human characteristic that other animals do not have.\nThough some species shed tears as a result of pain or irritation, humans are currently known as the only creatures whose tears can be triggered by their feelings.\nCharles Darwin once declared emotional tears \"purposeless.\"\nContrary to Darwin's declaration, however, scientists have recently found that crying plays a far more important role than was once believed.",
        "2": "First, let's define the terms.\nCrying is scientifically defined as the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state.\nThese tears are called psychic or emotional tears.\nDifferentiated from psychic or emotional tears, non-emotional tears are divided into two types: basal tears and reflex tears.\nBasal tears flow continuously to moisturize the eyes.\nWhen you blink, basal tears clean your eyes, making the eyes' outer surface smooth, and helping you see clearly.\nNormally, you are not conscious of the flow of basal tears until your eyes get dry due to their absence.\nReflex tears are the tears you shed in spite of yourself when, for instance, you slice a raw onion or encounter a cloud of dust.\nThese tears help clear the eyes of such irritants as the gas from the onion or dust particles.\nWhen a tear is produced from the lacrimal gland, you blink in spite of yourself, spreading the tear as a film across your eye.\nYour tear then has two fates.\nFirst, it can drain down the tiny hole in the corner of the eye, like the sink plug in your kitchen, and then flow through your nose.\nThat is why your nose runs when you cry.",
        "3": "Second, when you are in a state of extreme sadness or pain, you have a really good cry, and your drainage system simply cannot deal with the volume of tears.\nThe excess fluid now flows over your eyelids and down your cheeks.\nThere have been many theories about the origin and function of emotional tears.\nA prevailing theory in the 1600s held that emotions ― especially love ― heated the heart, which generated water vapor in order to cool itself down.\nThis theory was rejected when Niels Stensen, a scientist in Denmark, discovered in 1662 that not emotions but the lacrimal gland, the tiny structure on the inside corner of the eye, is the proper origin of tears.\nStensen's theory was that tears were simply a way to keep the eye moist.\nA theory that crying removes toxic substances from the body that build up during times of stress gained some popularity in the 20th century, although not scientifically proven.\nIn recent years, evidence is mounting in support of new theories.\nOne of them is that emotional tears trigger social bonding and human connection.\nWe cry from a very early age to bring about a connection with others, for we come into the world physically and emotionally unequipped to deal with anything on our own.\nEven though we become more capable as we grow, we never quite grow out of occasional attacks of helplessness.\nCrying signals to other people that we are experiencing some important problem that is beyond our ability to cope with.\nIn a 2016 study, test subjects were shown a photograph of someone visibly crying, and then shown the same photo with the tears removed.\nThe result: they were much more likely to reach out to the person in the first photo.",
        "4": "All types of tears have three layers: a thin mucus layer that sits directly on the eye, a watery layer in the middle, and a thin oily layer on top that prevents the tear from evaporating.\nInterestingly enough, scientists have found that the types of tears are chemically different from each other.\nCompared to basal tears, the watery portion of reflex tears is larger and has higher levels of antibodies that can stop harmful microorganisms.\nOn the other hand, emotional tears contain more protein.\nOne interpretation is that this higher protein content makes emotional tears stickier, so they stick to the skin more strongly and run down the face more slowly, making them more likely to be seen by others.\nAccording to that interpretation, the more visible tears are, the more likely they are to bring out compassion from observers.\n\"There must have been some point in time, evolutionarily, when tears became something that automatically set off empathy and compassion in another,\" says Michael Trimble, a doctor at University College London.",
        "5": "A less touching theory about emotional tears focuses on crying's ability to manipulate others.\nResearchers believe that not only babies but also adults use tears as a tool for getting what they need, whether they're aware of it or not.\nJonathan Rottenberg, an emotion researcher and professor of psychology at the University of South Florida, says that we learn early on that crying can greatly reduce anger from other people.\nThat is why he thinks tears are common in fights between lovers.\nWhen someone feels guilty, they have a greater chance of being forgiven as long as tears are running down their face, says Rottenberg.\nSome researchers are even looking into the molecules in tears to see if there is one that is responsible for reducing aggression.\nThen, a question arises: if tears are so important for human bonding, bringing out compassion, and reducing aggression, do people who do not cry have problems making social connections?\nThe answer is, yes, mostly.\nPsychologists have discovered that such people have a tendency to withdraw and describe their relationship experiences as less connected.\nAnother interesting fact is that while emotional states affect the production of tears, the contrary is also true.\nFor example, patients who have great difficulty producing tears, due to some diseases, also have difficulty identifying their own feelings.\nAs a result, their social relationships tend to become troubled.",
        "6": "Despite its benefits, crying is not always followed by immediate relief.\nIn an experiment in which participants were shown a sad movie and had their mood measured right after watching it, those who had cried were actually in a worse mood than those who had not.\nHowever, after some time, the criers reported being in a better mood than they had been before watching the movie.\nCrying did relieve their mood, provided that they were given enough time for the benefits of crying to set in.\nModern research into crying is still young, but evidence is mounting that crying demonstrates our deep connections with our world.\nSo go on and wear your tears with pride.",
        "7": "《Your Eyes Are the Windows to Your Soul》\nEyes are often called the windows to the soul.\nEyes, as it turns out, provide a lot of information about a person's emotional state.\nOne telling example is a smile.\nWhen you are truly happy, you smile not only with your mouth but also with your eyes.\nIn contrast, when people fake a smile, they usually forget about their eyes.\nIf the eye is the window into the soul, the pupil is quite literally an opening into the eye.\nThe pupil dilates or contracts to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.\nWe all know that our pupils get smaller in the light and bigger in the dark.\nThis is the pupillary light response.\nThe pupillary light response is not just a mechanical reaction to light.\nThe pupils also adjust according to our emotions.\nIt is related to an alarm system in the body that prepares us to take action whenever we detect a threat or an opportunity in our environment.\nEncounter a bear while walking through the woods, and your alarm system goes on alert.\nYour heart and breathing rates increase, you begin to sweat, and your pupils dilate.\nThe pupils will have adjusted themselves to the threat.\nMeet an attractive person at a party, and your heart and breathing rates increase, you begin to sweat, and your pupils dilate.\nThe pupils will have adjusted themselves to the opportunity.\nNone of these pupillary responses is under your control.\nPerhaps that is why eyes are called the windows to the soul, revealing your true emotional state, regardless of your will to control it."

        "2": "During the 1960s revolutionary changes emerged in American society.\nInitially, the demands for change were triggered by sustained racial discrimination against African-Americans.\nLed by the Civil Rights Movement, which called for all people to receive equal treatment, people who had been treated unfairly in American society began to organize collective movements to regain their suppressed rights.\nThey demanded equality for all people regardless of race, sex, age, disability, national origin, religion, or other characteristics.\nIt was this social environment of the 1960s that made American women begin to challenge both the visible and the invisible restrictions put upon them by outdated cultural and societal stereotypes, struggling to gain their due rights as equals to men.\nThe following story shows you how a brave female athlete, Kathrine Switzer, was able to overcome one barrier in the male-dominated athletic culture.",
        "3": "Kathrine Switzer was born in Germany, the daughter of a major who was stationed there in the United States Army.\nShe graduated from high school in Virginia and entered Syracuse University in the mid-1960s.\nHaving had a passion for running since childhood, she looked for a women's running team in the university.\nTo her regret, there was none, neither there nor anywhere.\nShe trained unofficially with the men's cross-country team.\nThere she caught the eye of 50-year-old volunteer coach, Arnie Briggs.\nShe wanted to run in the famous Boston Marathon, but Briggs intensely discouraged her, saying women could not run in the marathon because they were too fragile to complete the long distance race.\nUpon her insistence, Briggs finally agreed to let her sign up for the race.\nSwitzer and her coach checked the rule book and entry form.\nAt that time, it was taken for granted that only men could enter the race.\nTo avoid the controversy that would come with her registration as a woman, she entered as \"K.V. Switzer.\"",
        "4": "In 1967, the Boston Marathon was on April 19.\nShe had no idea she was going to become a part of the race's history.\nShe was given the bib number 261.\nThere were 741 people listed on the program.\nBoston had always been a mecca for marathon runners.\nNow Switzer, too, was one of the pilgrims.\nAt about the four-mile mark in the race, there was a man in the middle of the road shaking his finger at Switzer.\nHe was Jock Semple, the race director of the marathon.\nHe screamed, \"Get the hell out of the race and give me your number!\"\nThen he swiped down her front, trying to tear off her bib.\nSwitzer was so surprised and frightened that she turned to run away.\nSemple continued to swipe at the bib number on her back.\nHaving never felt such embarrassment and fear before, she wondered if she should step off the course.\nThat thought, however, was only a flicker.\nShe knew if she quit, nobody would ever believe that women could run a 26-plus mile race.\nHer emotion turned from fear to anger.\n\"I have to finish this race. I have to, even on my hands and knees.\nIf I don't finish, people will say women can't do it.\"",
        "5": "At last she crossed the finish line and stepped into a different life.\nSwitzer finished the race in 4 hours, 20 minutes, proving with an official bib number and time that women are capable of running long distances.\nTo the male runners it was a one-off event.\nWithout a doubt, it was a lot more than that to Switzer.\nAfter the historic race in Boston, Switzer, along with other women runners, tried to convince the Boston Athletic Association to allow women to participate in the marathon.\nFinally, in 1972, women were officially allowed to run in the Boston Marathon for the first time.\nHer ceaseless efforts to achieve gender equality in the marathon finally led the 1984 Olympic Games to introduce the women's marathon for the first time in its history.\nFor her part, Switzer was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2011 for creating a social revolution by empowering women around the world through running.",
        "6": "In 2017, at the age of 70, Kathrine Switzer once again ran in the marathon, getting the media's attention globally with the same bib number ― 261 ― that was assigned to her in 1967.\nThat marked the 50th anniversary of her historic marathon in Boston.\nAt her advanced age, she finished in 4:44:31, a remarkable achievement.\nShe had told the media that she decided to run in the Boston Marathon again to prove that even people at her age could successfully complete a marathon.\nNow she dreams of another revolution in athletics by securing acceptance of the notion that elderly runners should be able to compete with younger ones.\nIn honor of Switzer's accomplishment, the Boston Athletic Association announced it would retire bib number 261, and not assign it to any future runner.",
        "7": "《The African-American Civil Rights Movement》\nThe African-American Civil Rights Movement was a long fight for racial equality that went on for over 100 years, beginning after the American Civil War ended in the 1860s.\nThe Civil Rights Movement has its background in the anti-slavery movement before the Civil War.\nPeople opposing the slavery system thought slavery was morally wrong and wanted it to end.\nDuring the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.\nAfter the Civil War, however, many southern states continued to treat African-Americans as second class citizens.\nThey implemented laws that kept black people separate from white people.\nFor example, public facilities such as restaurants, restrooms, and buses had separate spaces for white people and for black people.\nThe Civil Rights Movement gained momentum in the 1950s.\nLeaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks paved the way for non-violent protests that led to changes in the law.\nIn 1955, Rosa Parks, an African-American woman living in Montgomery, Alabama, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger.\nThis sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the racial segregation, which lasted for more than a year and brought Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the forefront of the movement.\nKing led a number of non-violent protests, including the famous \"March on Washington\" in 1963, a landmark in the African-American Civil Rights Movement.\nIn 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.\nThis act outlawed the segregation of black people in America.\nIt also outlawed discrimination based on race, national background, and gender."

        "1": "《Bees Are Dying》\nIn March, 2017, cereal lovers in the United States were surprised to find that Buzz the Bee, the famous honeybee mascot of a cereal maker, was gone from the boxes of the maker's cereals.\nIt was the decision of the cereal maker to remind people that the world's population of bees is fast diminishing.\nThe cereal maker's decision did not come out of the blue.\nEarlier in that year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared that in the United States the bumblebee was endangered.\nThe population of the bumblebee in the U.S. had shrunk by nearly 90 percent since the late 1990s, according to the Wildlife Service.\nSimilar phenomena have occurred in other parts of the world.\nIn Central Europe, honeybee colonies have declined by 25 percent since 1985.\nIn Hanyuan County, China, where pear and apple trees fill the landscape, farmers are forced to pollinate their fruit by hand due to the severe decline in the population of honeybees.\nAll in all, bees are disappearing all over the world, and that worries scientists and farmers, among others.\nWhy are they worrying? What is special about bees?",
        "2": "Bees are one of nature's most effective pollinators.\nIf they do not move pollen from one blossom to another, one third of the crops we consume would be severely affected.\nThey would have to be pollinated by other means, or they would produce significantly less food.\nGrains like wheat, rice, and corn are not much affected by the decline of bees because they are pollinated primarily by the wind.\nFruits, vegetables, and some crops for farm animals, however, might disappear without bees.\nApples, strawberries, watermelons... the list is almost endless.\nWhy, then, are bees disappearing?\nThere is general agreement among scientists that declines in bee populations are the product of multiple factors that can act alone or in combination.\nRoughly speaking, bee declines arise from three factors.\nThe first one is sickness.\nBees suffer from their own diseases and from parasites that weaken and often kill them.\nMany beekeepers agree that the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor, is the most serious threat to bees.\nVarroa is a very small mite that feeds on the blood of the bee and spreads from hive to hive.\nIn addition to weakening the bees, Varroa can also spread diseases.",
        "3": "A second factor that is causing bee declines is poor nutrition.\nBees feed on flowers, so they need a stable supply.\nWhen there are not enough diverse blooming flowers during the bee season, bees are not able to sufficiently feed themselves.\nThe lack of diverse flowers is in part the result of changes in agriculture.\nOver the past century, agriculture has become increasingly industrialized.\nOne of the outstanding features of industrial agriculture is monoculture, the agricultural practice of planting one crop in a given area year after year.\nMonoculture leads to poor nutrition for bees because a single plant cannot meet their nutrient requirements.\n\"Bees need a varied diet of different pollens in order to grow into strong, healthy workers,\" explains Dr. Heather Mattila, a honeybee biologist at Wellesley College.\nAlso, large industrial facilities, playgrounds, and golf courses are making matters worse by destroying bee habitats that were once filled with diverse flowers.\n\"A green space can be a green desert unless it has flowering plants that are friendly to bees,\" Dr. Mattila adds.",
        "4": "One more suspected factor that is contributing to the bees' poor nutrition is climate change.\nIncreasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and more irregular and extreme weather have impacted bee populations.\nFor example, scientists in Poland have documented how honeybees are responding to changes in the climate.\nTheir first winter flight date, the wakening moment after winter, has advanced by more than one month during the last 25 years due to increasing temperatures.\nBecause patterns of flowering do not always match the bees' first winter flight, bees are likely to suffer from food shortages.\nWidespread use of pesticides, common in industrial agriculture, is the third major factor that is leading to the decline of bees.\nThere are several ways bees can be killed by pesticides.\nOne of them is direct contact.\nWhen bees are on the flowers at the time of the application of a pesticide, the bees die immediately.\nIn this case, the queen and the other bees in the hive are not affected and the colony survives.",
        "5": "If bees avoid direct contact with pesticides, they can still be contaminated through pollen, the air, water or soil.\nThis has deadly effects on a bee colony because a contaminated bee transports the pesticide to the colony, in pollen or nectar, or on its body.\nThe results are often disastrous, and the affected colony eventually collapses.\nSome pesticides do not affect adult bees, but do cause damage to young, immature bees.\nOther types of pesticides could affect bees' brains, making the bees slow learners and sometimes causing them to lose their ability to find nectar.\nSeveral ways to protect bees from pesticides are being proposed.\nOne of them is to apply pesticides in the evening.\nThis will minimize the impact of pesticides on bees, as bees take food during the day.\nCertain crops such as melons and cucumbers have flowers that will be open for only a single day.\nFor such crops, pesticides should be applied when the flowers are closed, as it will reduce the impact on bees.\nAll in all, in order to protect bees from harmful pesticides, there should be national and international collaboration among beekeepers, growers, governments, and pesticide manufacturers.",
        "6": "As individuals, we can also help save bees.\nWe can plant flowers in our gardens that are helpful for bees and try not to contaminate these flowers with pesticides.\nAlso, we can buy and consume more organic produce that is grown without or with minimum use of pesticides.\nThis way we can expect commercial growers to reduce their use of pesticides.\nWhen we take these seemingly small actions to help bees, we help them make our world healthier.\nIn other words, we help ourselves by helping bees.",
        "7": "《What Happens When Something in a Food Chain Goes Extinct?》\nAll living organisms hold a place in the food chain, structured around the transfer of energy needed for life through an ecosystem: from sunlight to plant to rabbit to fox to worm, to give a simple example.\nBecause this energy transfer involves members of a food chain interacting with one another and with their environment, extinction of one species can have multiple effects on others.\n《Explosion of Prey Population》\nWhen a predatory species becomes threatened or extinct, this removes a check and balance in the food chain on the population of its prey.\nAs a result, the prey population can explode.\nFor instance, the huge increase in the deer population in the U.S. in the latter half of the 20th century stemmed partly from the diminished population of wolves.\n《Ripple Effect》\nExtinction of one species can threaten the existence of another species.\nIn Britain, for instance, sheep kept the grass short in many regions.\nShort grass is the red ant's preferred habitat.\nWhen the sheep population diminished, the red ant population also shrank.\nIn turn, the reduced red ant population led to the extinction of a butterfly species that feeds on red ant eggs.\n《Disrupted Habitat》\nThe extinction of a species may alter the physical environment.\nFor instance, the accidental introduction of the predatory brown tree snake to Guam wiped out 10 of the 12 native bird species on the island.\nWithout birds to spread seeds, there may be fewer tree species in Guam's future, fundamentally changing its forest habitat."

        "2": "Then, in early modern times, the first invention that laid the foundation for robotics was perfected ― clocks.\nThe mechanisms that ran them were called \"clockworks.\"\nThe 17th century is known to have been the golden age of \"clockwork automatons.\"\nWalking toy soldiers were built, along with toy ducks that drank water and toy boys that over and over would write a single letter with a pen.\nThese moving dolls were distant ancestors to today's robots.\nThey were merely capable of repeating the same action.\nStill, they marked the beginning of modern mechanical engineering and kept alive the dream of robots.\nFurther advances of mechanical engineering have given sharper edges to the imaginary machines that work for human beings.\nThe term \"robot,\" referring to such artificial creatures, was first coined in Czech writer Karel Capek's play, Rossum's Universal Robots (1920).\nRobot is a Czech word for slave.\nIn this play, robots are specifically made to do the hard labor so that human beings can live lives of leisure and comfort.\nThis vision of automatic workers did not take long to be realized.\nIn 1937, the earliest known industrial robot was completed, opening the first phase of robotics ― the age of industrial robots.",
        "3": "Industrial robots, though having made fast progress since then, are not yet thinking machines which can act independently.\nThey are more like advanced clockworks, although far more precisely operated.\nNow, industrial robots can be seen to do hard labor everywhere around us, especially in factories and laboratories.\nThey perform repetitive and dangerous tasks, lift heavy objects, conduct tests in severe environments, or help medical doctors with difficult operations.\nProducts are manufactured infinitely faster and cheaper than before, thanks to them.\nThey are sent deep into the sea, into volcanoes, and even to other planets where they are subjected to extreme conditions, doing what humans might be supposed to do at the risk of their lives.\nModern industrial robots have significantly contributed to comfort and safety in work environments.\nNow, for the first time in human history, robots are about to evolve into independent, \"living\" creatures.\nThe invention of artificial intelligence (AI) broke a barrier no human generation had ever reached before, and nobody knows for sure what might become of the innovative leap.\nSo far, the prospect seems to have stirred more fears than hopes.\nIn 2016, for example, when Google's AlphaGo beat the world's elite go players, one by one, the shock and dread that robots might finally assume \"life\" struck the global population.\nThe fear was that an independent creature might someday escape human control.",
        "4": "The fear that human beings might create a living thing that cannot be controlled is not new.\nIt is called Frankenstein anxiety and owes its name to the novel ― Frankenstein (1818) by Mary Shelley.\nIn this book, scientist Victor Frankenstein collects pieces of dead bodies and from them creates a \"Monster.\"\nThe Monster turns out to have superb intelligence and eventually turns against its creator, with dreadful results.\nAfter Shelley, in the genre of science fiction, countless artificial beings were depicted as becoming dangerous.\nHuman beings were seen to be replaced with their own creation.\nIn the movie The Terminator, released in the 1980s, highly developed AI robots finally decide to wipe the human race off the face of the earth.\nIf robots are supposed to follow the way of human imagination, we see a horrible future ahead, don't we?\nMaybe, but probably not.\nFictional imagination concerning robots not only rang warning bells but also offered a way forward.\nIsaac Asimov, sometimes referred to as the father of science fiction, who first coined the word \"robotics,\" saw no point in too much worry.\nHe pointed out that robots are machines ― advanced, but still machines.\nHe believed that safety factors should be built into robots, as well as into other machines like cars and planes.\nThe safety measures Asimov devised for his fictional robots were the famous \"Three Fundamental Laws of Robotics.\"",
        "5": "The Laws set the priorities for robotic behavior.\nAt all cost, human life should be protected.\nIn his fictional world full of robots, the Laws are enforced without exception.\nAsimov's fictional vision has proved insightful and has helped global leaders to plan and prepare for the future.\nIn 2011, British scientists, engineers, and scholars suggested that designers, builders, and users of robots follow five ethical principles.\nThe principles focus on human safety, making it clear that robots should serve human beings.\nSimilar actions have followed.\nIn February, 2017, the European Parliament approved a resolution calling for the creation of laws on robotics, based on Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.",
        "6": "Our future with thinking robots is now upon us.\nWe cannot just stop developing them because of undue fears.\nWhether it will turn out to be a dream or a nightmare depends on our conscious choices and actions.\nThorough discussions and constant monitoring are essential in guiding us in the right direction for robot development.\nWe do not have to be too afraid, but we should be wiser and more considerate in picturing and planning for a future with robots, carefully weighing many different possibilities.\nImagination, a uniquely human characteristic, will prove helpful once again.\nAs a famous robotics engineer once said, \"Robots will go as far as human imagination can take them.\"",
        "7": "《Three Laws of Robotics》\nIn his fictional world full of intelligent robots, Isaac Asimov introduced a series of laws that would help govern these robots' behavior in society, which amounted to laws and ethics for robots.\nThey are called the Three Laws of Robotics and place their main emphasis on protecting the safety of human beings against possible malfunctions of robots.\nThe original Three Laws were as follows:\n1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.\nThe Three Laws first appeared in a story by Asimov in 1942, but later Asimov felt the need to implement the so-called Zeroth Law, which stated:\n0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\nThe Zeroth Law takes priority over the other laws and seeks to prevent robots from doing harm to a majority of the human race for the benefit of a small number of human beings.\nThese laws have had great influence, both on the genre of science fiction and on the direction of robot engineering, which finds itself engaged in heated debates on how to control AI."

        "1": "《The Hidden Heroes Inside Us》\nA human being has about 10 trillion human cells, but there are also other tiny creatures living in the human body.\nThese creatures are clusters of bacteria in different parts of the body, such as on the surface or in the deep layers of the skin, in the mouth and the nose, and in the lungs and the stomach.\nBut the greatest number of bacteria, about 100 trillion that weigh up to 2 kg, reside in the gut.\nThis may sound somewhat frightening, but these bacteria have a crucial and positive influence on our health.\nThe first scientist who paid attention to these microbes in the gut and their importance was Ilya Mechinikov, who won the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his studies on the immune system.\nHe was living in Paris in the late 19th century when thousands of people were suffering from cholera, a disease that was sweeping the European continent.\nAs a scientist, Mechinikov was naturally driven to study this disease, which eventually led him to eat food containing the cholera bacteria.\nRemarkably, he didn't get sick.\nIntrigued, he decided to increase his sample size and recruited a colleague to do the same.\nThe colleague didn't get sick either.\nBut when he tested on another colleague, the poor man became critically ill and almost died.",
        "2": "What made them react to the same disease in different ways?\nBy studying cholera under the microscope, Mechinikov found that certain species of bacteria from the human gut supported and stimulated the cholera's growth, while other species prevented it.\nAfter further study, he realized that our gut bacteria were essential for human health, and that the right balance of microbes inside of us could help prevent disease.\nSadly, this view was not widely accepted at the time and was eventually forgotten after Mechinikov died in 1916.\nA decade later, antibiotics were discovered.\nAntibiotics have saved countless lives by giving doctors and scientists the means to kill harmful germs that infect wounds, cause deadly diseases, and spread through food.\nHowever, as time has passed, the miraculous power of antibiotics has caused some doctors to use them too much.\nMoreover, people have come to see all germs as threats to good health, and as a result, they have done their best to keep their bodies clean of them.\nA war has been waged on microbes, and people have spent almost a century trying to kill them.\nUnfortunately, this attitude has had harmful effects on health, resulting in a rise in allergies and immune deficiencies.",
        "3": "Fortunately, scientists are beginning to see the relationship between microbes and the human body in a new light.\nAccording to recent studies, thousands of species of microbes in the gut have different functions, and good health is incredibly dependent upon the well-being of these numerous and diverse microbes.\nBy occupying our bodies first, they prevent harmful germs from growing there.\nTherefore, people with a healthy bacterial community may remain unaffected by slightly infected food, but those with fewer or unbalanced microbes may suffer from food poisoning.\nThey also facilitate our immune system by distinguishing between good substances that should be allowed into our bodies and harmful ones that should be rejected.\nTherefore, having insufficient germs or losing important ones leads to various health problems.\nSome microbes help the stomach digest some vegetables and milk.\nIf they are absent, it is difficult to absorb certain vegetables and milk, which eventually leads to an unbalanced diet and poorer health.\nOther bacteria help the body produce vitamins B and K, as well as important amino acids.",
        "4": "Some microbes in the gut determine whether particular drugs are toxic to the liver and whether or not other drugs will work to combat a heart condition.\nOther microbes regulate the appetite hormone, which makes a person feel full or hungry.\nLosing these microbes may result in increased body fat.\nOne recent study found that transplanting a lean mouse's gut bacteria into an overweight mouse's stomach made the overweight mouse lose weight.\nSimilarly, doing the reverse made the lean mouse gain weight.\nSome researchers who have realized the crucial role of microbes are trying to apply this knowledge to cure people.\nInstead of using antibiotics, they have found that introducing or increasing the necessary germs that the person lacks can cure some diseases.\nFor example, there were people who had a terrible form of diarrhea, so they had to go to the bathroom up to 20 times a day.\nThese people had not been helped by antibiotic therapy.\nResearchers transplanted some of the good microbes from a healthy donor into these patients' guts.\nOne day after they received their transplant, all their symptoms cleared up and the diarrhea vanished.\nThey were essentially healthy again.\nThe bacterial community in their own guts came to resemble the donor's bacterial community.",
        "5": "Given this knowledge, nutritionists suggest the following ways to keep our guts healthy.\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is through our food.\nGood microbes can be found in many of the foods we eat and whatever else gets to our mouths.\nBy eating foods that contain beneficial bacteria, such as yogurt, gimchi, and natto, or choosing a diet packed with good, fresh nutrients, such as garlic, onions, and unprocessed grains rich in fiber, we can cultivate good microbes.\nOf course, it is also important to protect the germs that already exist in our bodies by avoiding processed food.\nHeavily processed foods such as frozen food, packaged snacks, and canned food not only lack beneficial bacteria but also contain chemicals that damage the good microbes in our guts.\nAnother way to increase beneficial microbes is to spend more time in nature.\nPlaces with diverse life forms, such as woods, beaches, parks, or even small farms and gardens, are abundant with diverse bacteria that germ-free urban environments lack.\nIn addition, we should use antibiotics wisely; we must use them much less frequently.\nAlthough antibiotics play a crucial role in keeping us healthy by eliminating dangerous germs, they cannot tell good bacteria from bad ones.\nTherefore, whenever we use antibiotics, we inevitably damage beneficial bacteria as well as the harmful bacteria that we want to get rid of.",
        "6": "If we can affect microbes and they can affect our bodies, it makes little sense to talk about the two separately.\nMaybe it is time to stop thinking of microbes and ourselves as different beings.\nWe need to start thinking of the microbes in our guts as a part of our bodies, like the blood cells and the neurons, and take care of them just as we take care of our skin and our teeth.",
        "7": "《BIOLOGY: Antibiotic Resistance》\nThe introduction of antibiotics during the 20th century has made many previously dangerous diseases easily treatable.\nBut today, more and more of our antibiotics are becoming less effective.\nDid something go wrong to make them stop working?\nThe problem is not with the antibiotics but the bacteria they were made to fight.\nJust like any other organisms, individual bacteria can undergo random mutations.\nMany of these mutations are harmless.\nHowever, sometimes the mutation makes the bacteria resistant to a certain antibiotic.\nBacteria compete against each other for food.\nAs the non-resistant bacteria are killed off by the antibiotics we use, there is more room for the resistant ones to prosper.\nInterestingly, the resistance is usually coded by the DNA of bacteria and can be transferred to other bacteria.\nOver time, as the resistant genes among bacteria multiply, super bacteria that can resist multiple antibiotics can emerge.\nFor instance, super bacteria like salmonella produce chemical substances that break down several types of antibiotics before antibiotics can do any damage to them.",
        "8": "Fortunately, there is good news.\nScientists are trying to develop novel antibiotics that can kill super bacteria.\nHowever, avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections that can resolve on their own, can be more effective on this matter.\nExcessive use of antibiotics on animal farms should be also regulated.\nGiving animals antibiotics to prevent illness or promote growth can generate resistance in animal bacteria that can later be transmitted to humans.\nIn the home, antibacterial cleaning products such as household cleaners or bath products can lead to antibiotic resistance.\nStudies have shown that plain soap is just as good at killing bacteria in the home as products labeled antibacterial.\nIn the war against super bacteria, decreasing the attacks on bacteria may sometimes work better than increasing the use of antibiotics and antibacterial products against them.\nAnimals get antibiotics.\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria can remain on meat from animals.\nWhen not handled or cooked properly, the bacteria can spread to humans."

This bank has no cash. This is a cash-free bank.\"\nThen the employee points at a poster on the wall that says, \"cash-free.\"\nDisappointed, the robber lowers his gun and prepares to leave.\nJust before leaving, he turns and asks, \"Where else can I go?\"\nThis really happened in Sweden in 2013.\nWhile the idea of a bank without cash may seem shocking to some, Swedish people would find it surprising that this outdated man tried to rob a bank at all.\nIn Sweden, only half of all banks deal with cash.\nMoreover, even if the robber had succeeded in getting a great deal of cash, he would have had trouble spending it because many places no longer accept cash.",
        "2": "《Toward a Cash-Free Society》\nPeople in Sweden now need to use a debit card, a credit card, or a payment app instead of cash.\nCards and apps are used for everything in Sweden, including buying snacks on the street and giving small donations to charity.\nAs a result, fewer and fewer people are carrying any cash at all.\nIn 2015, cash transactions accounted for barely 20% of all payments made in Sweden.\nIn fact, carrying around too much cash or trying to use it too often raises suspicions.\nIf the cash-free life in Sweden sounds strange, try to remember when you last paid for the bus or the subway with cash.\nThe shift toward cash-free transactions is a global trend.\nFrom Western Europe and North America to Southeast Asia and Africa, noncash transactions are growing much faster than cash transactions.\nIn countries with a developing economy such as Russia, China, and India, non-cash transactions increased by 20-40% between 2011 and 2015, while cash transactions grew only about 10%.\nIn developed nations such as Sweden, Belgium, Australia, and Canada, the volume of cash transactions dropped while non-cash transactions continued to grow.",
        "3": "《What Has Triggered a Cash-Free Society》\nThe increase in the number of non-cash transactions has been triggered by the advancement of ICT (Information and Communication Technology).\nNew technologies have given rise to more convenient means of payment.\nThe invention of the Internet has brought about an explosive increase in the use of credit cards by making it possible for banks, sellers, and customers to exchange information instantly.\nIn the past, credit cards without magnetic strips were troublesome to use and often unsafe.\nAs the Internet became more popular and computer-programming technology became more sophisticated, Internet banking and Internet payment systems emerged.\nMore recently, wireless communication technology and the smartphone have led to the invention of mobile cards and payment apps.\nIn addition to the invention of various payment systems, the Internet has created a shopping environment where paying with cash is nearly impossible.\nWhen you are buying a book at a local store, you may choose to pay with a credit card or cash.\nHowever, if you are buying the same book at an online store, handing cash to the seller is impossible.\nYou need a method of payment that allows you to send money to another person regardless of the physical distance.",
        "4": "《The Benefits of a Cash-Free Economy》\nIt seems that the global shift to a cash-free economy is inevitable.\nWill cash eventually disappear as some economists have forecast?\nSome people argue it will happen faster than expected; they expect a cash-free society to be much better.\nOne enormous benefit of a cash-free economy is that it prevents crime.\nNot only does it prevent ash-related crimes such as robbery and theft, but it can also reduce many other crimes.\nBecause electronic transactions are easier to track than cash payments, it makes crimes involving cash harder to commit and easier to discover.\nAccording to Ken Rogoff, the author of The Curse of Cash, limiting the use of cash can reduce tax evasion, trafficking, smuggling, robbery, and bribery.\nThat is why some governments are encouraging non-cash transactions.\nIn France, it is now illegal to use cash for anything more than 1,000 euro.\nIndia, too, decided to phase out all 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee bills in the hope of reducing tax evasion and decreasing black markets.\nWhile preventing crimes is the biggest benefit of a cash-free economy, there are other benefits, too.\nNot having cash saves resources spent on printing money.\nMaking a coin often costs more money than the value represented by the coin.\nFor example, in Korea, it costs more than 30 won to produce a single 10-won coin.\nSome also argue that becoming cash-free makes the national economy more visible; it is easier to see whether or not the government is using money correctly.\nAbove all, cash-free transactions are simply convenient, as anyone who hates to carry around lots of coins knows.",
        "5": "《The Problems of a Cash-Free Economy》\nOthers, on the other hand, are convinced that a cash-free economy must never happen.\nThe biggest problem with a cash-free economy is the lack of privacy.\nIf all transactions are done electronically, they can all be technically traceable by the government.\nThis is frightening for anyone who does not believe that the government will use this power wisely and within limits.\nAnother problem is that electronic transactions require technology and technological skills.\nWill countries with less developed technology be left behind?\nWill people who are not familiar with modern technology, such as old people, be further disadvantaged?\nIt is also questionable whether going cash-free will affect the crime rate in the long term.\nEven as old-fashioned crimes such as robbery and bribery are reduced, new crimes may replace them.\nAlready criminals are adapting to new technologies, using electronic card readers to steal money and robbing banks by hacking.\nHowever, the biggest difficulty with a cash-free society is the cultural and emotional meaning that we have given to cash.\nThe sight of bills as a sign of wealth and the satisfactory feeling of holding them in our hands cannot be easily replaced.",
        "6": "Perhaps it is too soon to predict the fate of cash.\nHowever, one thing is clear: as society and technologies change, what we call money will change, too.\nIt is impossible to tell whether people one hundred years in the future will still use cash or not.\nStill, you can bet that they will have new ways to use money that we cannot even imagine now.\nAnd along with these new ways, they will have new problems, as well as new solutions.",
        "7": "Yet, Internet-initiated crime does not always play out online.\nSocial networking sites are also very helpful platforms for burglars or robbers.\nFor instance, 78 percent of burglars admit that they use social media to seek out their victims.\nOnline street views allow them to check out their victims' properties over the Internet.\nMoreover, the smartphone apps for social media all offer geographical information which can reveal your exact location, thus informing potential burglars when you're away from home.\nSo try to be careful about what information you post online, keep all of your software updated, and make secure passwords that are different for each site you log on to.\nIt is highly recommended that you disable the functions on your smartphone that show your location, at least when it comes to the social networking apps you use.\nUnfortunately these problems will probably never go away unless we invent a completely secure way of communicating and sharing with each other online."

        "2": "There are two ways to answer this question.\nOne is simply to track the achievements of precocious kids.\nThere is a mid-1980s study of adults who attended New York City's highly regarded Hunter College Elementary School, which was founded in the 1920s as a training ground for America's future intellectual elite and only admitted children with an IQ of 155 or above.\nYet the fate of the Hunter College child geniuses in the study was not greatness; it was simply being okay.\nThirty years down the road, the Hunter graduates were all doing pretty well and were reasonably well adjusted and happy.\nMost of them had good jobs and many had advanced degrees.\nBut surprisingly, none of the Hunter graduates became CEOs of world-famous corporations, prominent politicians, well-known writers, or Nobel Prize winners; there were no people who were nationally known in their fields.\nThey were genius kids, but they were not genius adults.\nA similar pattern emerged in Ontario, Canada, in the 1970s.\nThere was an elementary school with a team of elite runners.\nAt that time, there were 15 nationally-ranked runners who were 13 and 14 years old.\nAccording to research done ten years later, only one runner from that group became a top runner at the age of 24.",
        "3": "In fact, the number-one runner at the age of 24 was someone known as a poor runner when he was young, Doug Consiglio.\nDoug was thought to be an awkward kid.\nWhen he was 14, all the other kids asked, \"Why does he even bother?\"\nAnother way to look at precocity is to work backwards — to look at adult geniuses and see what they were like as kids.\nA number of studies have taken this approach, and they found a similar pattern.\nA study of 200 highly accomplished adults found that just 34 percent had been considered precocious as children.\nThere is also a long list of historical geniuses who were quite ordinary as children; the list includes Copernicus, Rembrandt, Bach, Newton, Beethoven, Kant, and Leonardo da Vinci.\nNone of these geniuses would have made it into Hunter College Elementary School.\nAs you can see from these studies, precocity is a trickier subject than people may ordinarily think.\nThe benefits of earlier mastery are often overestimated.\nThere are many people who either started out good and went bad or started bad and ended up good.",
        "4": "Early acquisition of skills — which is often what we mean by precocity — may be a misleading indicator of later success.\nWhen we call a child precocious, we have a very inaccurate definition of what we mean.\nGenerally, what we mean is that a person has an unusual level of intellectual or physical ability for his or her age.\nAdult success has a lot to do with more than that.\nIn our obsession with precocity, we are exaggerating the importance of being talented.\nRather, deliberate practice toward a goal is much more important than natural-born ability.\nFor example, when we say that a great musician is naturally gifted, does that tell us that he or she practices a lot, wants to practice a lot, or likes to practice a lot?\nPeople often cite Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as a child prodigy, someone who acquired his musical skills very early.\nHe started to compose music at the age of four.\nBy six, he traveled around Europe giving special performances with his father, Leopold.\nHe is, therefore, the perfect example of a precocious child.\nHowever, there are faults in the Mozart myth.\nFirst of all, the music he composed at four isn't any good.\nHis childhood works are basically arrangements of works by other composers.",
        "5": "Also, rather suspiciously, they were written down by his father.\nLeopold was the 18th-century version of a modern day parent who goes all out to make his or her child a star.\nIndeed Wolfgang's legendary precocity was exaggerated somewhat by his father's probable lying about his age.\nYoung Mozart's incredible musical ability might better be attributed to practice, practice, practice.\nCompelled to practice three hours a day from age three on, by age six, the young Wolfgang had practiced an astonishing 3,500 hours — three times more than anybody else in his peer group.\nMozart's famous precocity as a musician was not so much natural musical ability as his ability to work hard, his circumstances, and a father that pushed him to do so.\nA better example for what precocity really is may be the famous intellectual late-bloomer, Einstein.\nAccording to one biographer's description of the future physicist, Einstein displayed no remarkable native intelligence as a child.\nHis success seems to have come from certain habits and personality traits— curiosity, resolve, and determination.\nNo doubt, these traits are not particularly fascinating, but they are, perhaps, the more essential components of genius.",
        "6": "As seen from studies of precocity, a precocious child may not become a talented adult.\nFurthermore, a talented adult may not have been a precocious child.\nPredictions from childhood about adult performance cannot be made based on relatively fixed traits such as IQ and early acquisition of skills.\nInstead, many of the traits that really matter in predicting adult success are variable traits like creativity, determination, and leadership.\nThus, if you want to know whether a 14-year-old runner will be a good runner when he or she is 24, you must simply wait ten years to find out how truly successful he or she has become.",
        "7": "However, brain function is based not only on brain cells, but also on the connections between them called synapses.\nThese connections are the key to intelligence, creativity, and innovative thinking.\nScientists give birth to new revolutionary theories, businessmen come up with pioneering ideas, and artists create magnificent artworks because their neurons are arranged and wired in a certain way and their neural connections are stronger in particular brain regions.\nThe stronger our synapses are, the better our brain works, and the more productive and creative we become.\nHere comes the concept called neuroplasticity, which is the ability of the brain to reorganize neural pathways based on new experiences.\nDr. Matthew Bambling of the University of Queensland, Australia, believes that learning new things stimulates the brain and encourages it to rewire itself and change throughout life.\nBy learning new activities, our brain can develop new neural connections and thus alter its physical structure.\n\"The brain is a remarkably flexible and dynamic organ. The old saying 'use it or lose it' might never be more true than for the brain,\" he says.\n*stem cell (a cell in the body that can develop into any other type of cell)"

        "1": "《Psychology Behind Decision Making》\nFrench philosopher Descartes said, \"Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.\"\nBut is that true?\nIn the past, it was believed that human beings indeed had power over how we thought.\nAccording to this view, anyone could be like Sherlock Holmes.\nYou only had to think rationally, unaffected by biases and emotions.\nHowever, as we have discovered more and more about the brain and how it works, we have learned that this is not the case.\nThe problem is that thinking is the work of the brain, and the human brain, as it turns out, does not like to be rational.\nIn fact, it is structured in a way that it often prefers relying on a set of illogical thinking patterns instead of following reason all the time.\nThe brain's illogical thinking patterns that make unsound judgments are called cognitive bias.\nThere are many cognitive biases, but here are some of the most well known.",
        "2": "《Confirmation Bias》\nKevin: I’m a strict vegetarian. I’m convinced that my decision not to eat meat is rational and based on objective research. It seems to me that there is abundant scientific evidence for the benefits of a vegetarian diet. Studies in favor of eating meat, on the other hand, seem few and unreliable.\nSara: I’m a strong advocate for a balanced meat and plant diet. I do not doubt that my belief is the most reasonable one, considering all the scientific evidence. It seems to me that the most reliable studies show that avoiding meat can be dangerous for one’s health. The benefits of a vegetarian diet, on the other hand, are questionable at best.\nBoth Kevin and Sara are affected by confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that involves favoring information that confirms previously existing beliefs or biases. It impacts both how people gather information and how they interpret and recall it. Confirmation bias makes people unconsciously seek information that matches their own opinions, just as Kevin and Sara have done. When people encounter evidence that contradicts their view, confirmation bias helps them to interpret it in a way that supports their existing opinion or to dismiss it as unreliable. Thus, confirmation bias prevents us from looking at situations objectively, leading us to make poor or faulty choices.",
        "3": "Confirmation bias can appear in many forms. Racism, which is a dangerous human attribute that is essentially found in all societies, is an obvious example. So are prejudices against religion, gender, social class, and age. We even become firm in our loyalty to political parties and view them simply in “us” or “them” terms. Thus, we become hard wired to engage in faulty thinking.\nIt is almost impossible to overcome confirmation bias alone. However, Charles Darwin came up with a golden rule to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. He always noted observations that were opposed to what he thought and made an effort to investigate them. Paying extra attention to claims that challenge your opinions and attempting to discredit your own beliefs allow you to come to a conclusion in a more objective way.",
        "4": "《Bandwagon Effect》\nAre you going to watch that movie that is currently number one at the box office, even though you usually dislike superhero movies? Is that popular brand of crispy chips also your new favorite snack, even though you usually hate oily snacks? Do you love the new hairstyle that most teenagers are wearing now, even though you thought it looked silly before? If so, think again! You may be under the influence of the bandwagon effect.\nIn psychology, the bandwagon effect refers to a phenomenon in which people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs. Since human beings are social animals, the desire to conform is a part of our nature. Nevertheless, the bandwagon effect may have negative effects. It may cause people to vote for an already popular political candidate without carefully examining his or her character and policies. Worse, voters may be tricked into believing a certain candidate is popular and into supporting him or her.",
        "5": "This is how Adolf Hitler came to power early in his political career. When the Nazi party was new and unknown, he used radio broadcasts to make his party appear important and popular, and this convinced many German people to vote for the Nazis without knowing much about what the party really stood for. When Hitler and the Nazi party became popular, it was even easier to gain more and more supporters. People wanted to support the popular party because their friends supported the party, in spite of its horrible beliefs and actions.\nDoing what most people do is not always wrong. Sometimes products and ideas are popular because they are indeed good, and unpopular ones are avoided for good reasons. However, this is not always the case. That is why it is advisable to be aware of the bandwagon effect and guard yourself against it, even if you eventually decide that “most people\" are right. As Mark Twain said, “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.”\n• The German people unconditionally advocated the Nazis. This is a typical example of the bandwagon effect.",
        "6": "《Framing Effect》\nFraming is presenting an issue, argument, or statement in a certain way so that it will influence the audience's feelings or opinions. When such manipulation succeeds in altering the audience's decisions or judgments, it is called the framing effect.\nWe encounter framing effects everywhere in our daily lives. One of the areas where it is particularly useful and constantly used is business. For example, a customer may decide not to buy a gym membership that costs 500,000 won a year because it sounds too expensive. However, if the same membership is advertised as only 1,370 won a day, that same consumer may consider it cheap and eagerly purchase it.\nThe framing effect is also common in the mass media, where it often has a decisive impact on public opinion. Consider the fact that EU migrants cost the UK government ₤408.12 per second in public expenditures and contribute ₤463.35 per second in revenue. A newspaper may have a headline saying “EU migrants cost the UK government ₤408.12 per second in public expenditures” and add the rest later in the article, which will immediately lead many readers to have a hostile attitude toward immigrants. Another newspaper may write “EU migrants contribute ₤463.35 per second in revenue” as a headline and put the rest later, which will generate a completely different response among its readers.",
        "7": "There are several ways to prevent yourself from being influenced by the framing effect. First, you can reframe the information in your own way. For example, you can calculate how much a gym membership would cost per month or per year even though the gym owner advertises it as 1,370 won a day. Another way is to consider options and possibilities that are not included in the information. Some questions are framed in such a way that you are shown only two choices: Is competition good or bad? When you are faced with a question like this, it is important to remember that the effects of competition may differ according to the context.\nThese are only a few examples of many cognitive biases. Unfortunately, most of us are influenced by cognitive biases. What makes them dangerous is that they prevent us from realizing how unreasonable and unfair ideas may be. Therefore, accepting that we are not always right or logical is the first step to fight cognitive biases. Once we admit that our opinions may be biased, it becomes easier to accept the information that we do not like. Only then will we truly have the power over our thoughts that Descartes believed we had.",
        "8": "《Psychology: Two Kinds of Thinking: Fast and Slow》\nImagine you are in traffic and you have to make a left turn. While you are turning, you try to multiply 17 by 24 in your head. You’ll either quickly abandon the math problem or you’ll wreck your car. But what if you only had to add two and two while making the turn? You could do it easily. What is the difference between the two tasks? Most people would say that one of the tasks is easy and the other is hard. But Daniel Kahneman, who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics, says that there is more to it.\nKahneman says we solve almost all problems with two very different types of thinking: System 1 thinking and System 2 thinking. Adding two and two is done using System 1 — fast thinking that comes to mind automatically. The product of 17 and 24, however, uses System 2 — slow, deliberate thinking that you have to practice.\nSystem 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; it operates automatically. It is most helpful in familiar situations when time is short and immediate action is required. On the other hand, System 2 is slower; it requires more thinking. You have to plan ahead and consider all your options.",
        "9": "Most of the time, we are experts at what we are doing. We believe our impressions and act on our desires, so we use System 1 to solve most problems. System 2 watches what we do in the background and allows System 1 to control the situation. System 2 takes over when System 1 runs into difficulty. Another task of System 2 is to overcome the impulses and habitual patterns of System 1 when System 1 makes us feel overconfident about what we know and fails to acknowledge our ignorance, which leads us to make mistakes. System 2 is in charge of second-guessing and controlling our impulses. It helps us think twice about our decisions to make sure they are reasonable.\nAccording to Kahneman, System 2 clearly produces the superior answers in most situations. As a way to live our lives, however, constant control by System 2 is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. The best we can do is to learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try to avoid these mistakes when what we are doing is really important."

        "2": "In the early days of space travel, plants were grown on spacecraft primarily for research purposes — to better understand how they functioned and how they grew under different conditions, such as in microgravity and closed environments.\nIn recent years, however, NASA has seriously started investigating the potential of space-grown plants as a food source for astronauts.\nFresh food provides valuable nutrients as well as variety from the dried and packaged food that makes up most of an astronaut's diet.\nTherefore, finding a way to continually supply astronauts with fresh food has long been a desire for NASA.\nIn addition to health benefits, a bit of space gardening can also offer psychological benefits for astronauts.\nObserving and caring for plants can relieve their stress and improve their moods.\nPlants are a living, growing piece of Earth; therefore, their smell and color can inject a bit of sensory variety into an artificial lifeless environment.\nWith the sun rising and setting as many as sixteen times a day on the ISS, astronauts suffer from sleep disorders.\nSpace gardening can minimize this problem by helping astronauts mark the passing of time.",

        "5": "What about gravity?\nOn Earth, gravity has been thought to be necessary for roots to grow in the right direction — down and away from the leaves.\nIn a weightless environment, there is no up or down, so roots grow in all directions.\nResearch done in 2010 on the ISS, however, showed that gravity is not an important factor for plant growth.\nThis research proved that plants do not need gravity in order to grow normal root patterns and send their leaves upward toward the light.\nPlants grow more slowly, but as long as they have a light source above them, they are able to grow in the right direction.\nThe light source, however, needs to be sufficiently strong and directed.\nThis intense light source is indispensable for photosynthesis.\nOn Earth, most plants get this light from an obvious, abundant source, the sun.\nBut in a spacecraft, the sun's solar radiation is usually not best for plant growth because the position of the vehicle is constantly changing.\nThus, NASA has adopted LEDs for the light source.\nLEDs use less energy and last longer than old-fashioned lights.\nLEDs emit little heat, so moving them closer to the plants won't cause the plants to dry out or be burned.",
        "6": "Knowing how to grow plants in confined spaces is not just of benefit to salad-hungry astronauts.\nExperiments with plant production on the ISS have also proven valuable for agriculture on Earth, especially for areas in which water is scarce, soil is poor, or space is limited.\nFor example, vertical farming with an electric light source is now widely used in many countries.\nContinued experiments in space gardening will give more insight into how plants can be grown successfully in challenging environments.\nSpace gardening is good not only for astronauts in space but also for people on Earth, helping to solve the problems of how to face a changing climate and a growing world population.",
        "7": "《SPACE EXPLORATION: Space Trash》\nSome of it floats in space; much of it orbits Earth.\nYou can find it on the surfaces of Venus and Mars, and twenty tons of it is actually parked on the Moon.\nWhat is it?\nSome call it space trash, others refer to it as space junk.\nBoth terms identify the same items — man-made objects remaining in space though they no longer serve any useful purpose.\nMankind's journey into space began in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite.\nSince that time more than 4,000 satellites have been launched into orbit.\nWith so much traffic traveling into space, is it any wonder that a little trash has been left behind?\nIt is estimated that more than 500,000 pieces of trash are now floating through our region of the solar system.\nSome of them are as large as trucks while others are smaller than a tiny particle of paint.\nThere are a couple of relatively famous pieces of space trash.\nOne is a glove that floated away from the Gemini 4 crew during the first spacewalk by U.S. astronauts.\nThe other is the camera Michael Collins lost during the Gemini 10 mission.\nRocket boosters, pieces that came loose from spacecraft, and particles created by space collisions or explosions are other examples of the types of trash orbiting around Earth at speeds of up to 36,000 km per hour.",
        "8": "The main problem with space trash is the danger it poses to working satellites and manned spacecraft.\nNASA frequently replaces Space Shuttle windows damaged by orbiting flakes of paint.\nOne crack was about 1 millimeter in size and was caused by a \"space trash particle\" about 100 microns in size hitting the window at a high speed.\nMore than likely, this particle came from a solid rocket motor burn.\nBecause of the very great speed at which space trash travels, small pieces between 1 and 10 centimeters in size can break through the wall of a spacecraft and damage it.\nFor these reasons, scientists have created a space inspection network.\nGround stations track larger pieces of space trash so that collisions with working satellites or the Space Shuttle can be avoided.\nFuture plans include a cooperative effort among the governments of many nations to stop leaving trash in space and to possibly clean up the trash already there.\nWho knows, an occupation for the near future might be as a space trash collector.\n• A tiny particle of paint caused a crack on one of ISS's windows."

        "1": "《Haenyeo, the Korean Mermaids》\nJeju Island, South Korea, has real-life mermaids.\nTo be honest, they look nothing like the young, pretty mermaids in legends.\nThey are a group of elderly women who have little interest in showing off their fair skin or flowing long hair.\nNonetheless, they fascinate viewers with their tough presence and amazing diving skills.\nThese are the Korean haenyeo, women divers or \"women of the sea,\" native to Jeju Island.\nMoving gently underwater in their black wetsuits and weighted belts, these sea-worn women slide along the ocean floor to harvest seafood by hand.\nWith only flippers and underwater goggles but no breathing equipment, the haenyeo have braved the waters for ages.\nHere is the story of their history, their eco-friendly culture, and the significance of their disappearing yet meaningful traditions.",
        "2": "All over the world, diving has long been considered an exclusively male profession.\nSimilarly, on Jeju Island during the Joseon era, it was a man's job to dive deep enough to pick abalone for royal tribute.\nAt that time, the haenyeo's job was confined to collecting seaweed in shallow water.\nBut as time passed, the amount of abalone demanded as tribute kept increasing, and local officials exploited divers to meet the demand of the government.\nA lot of men died while diving and some of them fled Jeju to avoid being exploited.\nAs a result, officials compelled the haenyeo to dive deep for abalone in place of the men.\nThis is how, by the 1800s, the female divers of Jeju Island had come to outnumber their male counterparts.\nIn a society where the sea diving industry was mostly controlled by women, there is no denying that the haenyeo held great power over the economy of Jeju Island.\nIt is estimated that the haenyeo were responsible for more than half of the gross income earned by the island's marine industry during the 1960s.\nAlso during this time, the number of haenyeo reached over 23,000 on Jeju Island.\nThis number equaled about 20 percent of the island's women.\nFrom the late 1960s, however, Jeju Island turned to tourism for economic development.\nThe more women chose to work in tourism, the faster the number of haenyeo decreased.\nToday that number barely reaches 4,500, and most are elderly women 60 years or older.",
        "3": "Wearing a wangnoon, or an underwater goggle, a haenyeo with decades of experience can dive as deep as 10 meters with lead weights tied around her body to help her sink faster.\nThe black rubber wetsuit she wears is a relatively new invention.\nIt was not until the 1970s that the haenyeo began to wear the rubber wetsuits instead of mulsojungi, the traditional white tops and shorts made of cotton.\nThe haenyeo use an L-shaped tool called a kkakkuri to harvest seafood, such as shellfish, abalone, conch, and seaweed from the ocean floor.\nAfter one or two minutes underwater, they swim to the top and put their catch into a net clinging to a tewak.\nTewak refers to a round flotation device, often orange in color, that floats on the surface of the water to mark each diver's location.\nAfter taking a few deep breaths leaning on the tewak, they dive again to harvest more treasures.",
        "4": "The haenyeo maintain strict class divisions.\nThey are divided into three groups, depending on their experience and capability: sanggun (top league), junggun (middle league), and hagun (bottom league).\nThe haenyeo belonging to hagun usually dive three to five meters, while those in junggun can dive seven to eight meters.\nThe haenyeo in sanggun, however, can dive up to 10 meters without breathing for nearly two minutes.\nIt is a wonder that they can stay underwater for such a long time without an air tank.\nAlthough the haenyeo have a strict class relationship and work system, they are colleagues who look out for each other in their rough work environment.\nOn a normal work day, they gather between 6 and 8 a.m. to go to work, and when they are finished, they return home together.\nAt sea, they always work as a group.\nThey always follow a set route that ensures their own safety as well as the protection of the marine ecosystem.\nThey do compete for their catch, but at the same time, they protect each other and the sea.\nThe haenyeo community has a strong bond.\nThe haenyeo who gather a lot of shellfish divide their harvest with the young or the old haenyeo who catch little.\nIn addition, they set rules regarding the boundaries of the harvesting waters, the process of harvesting seafood, and when to take a break from harvesting.\nThese decisions are made by the haenyeo themselves through discussions.",
        "5": "The haenyeo culture has promoted environmental sustainability with its eco-friendly methods of fishing.\nTheir work involves no electric or gasoline equipment.\nThey work only for a limited time each day, and they never collect more than what is absolutely necessary.\nDoing this, they can protect and preserve the ecosystems of the sea.\nIn other words, the haenyeo understand the marine life around them and try to live with it.\nThey have been farming these waters for generations and have observed what hurts and what helps the local marine populations.\nPart of becoming a haenyeo is learning the rules for when you can and cannot collect certain species.\nWhen certain sea creatures are reproducing, the haenyeo forbid themselves from taking any of those creatures.\nIn addition, they do not harvest anything too small; conch must be at least 7 centimeters long and abalone 10 centimeters long to be gathered.\nTo keep the sea clean is another eco-friendly aspect of the haenyeo culture.\nOne day a month, the haenyeo serve as guardians of the sea.\nOn that day, they pass over treasures in search of discarded waste, such as Styrofoam, cigarettes, fish traps, and candy wrappers.",
        "6": "Sadly, the number of haenyeo is decreasing.\nBut without knowing about the haenyeo, a visitor to Jeju Island cannot fully grasp the society, culture, and history of the island.\nThe recent opening of the Jeju Island Haenyeo Museum and multiple haenyeo schools is a step forward in the revival of the haenyeo culture.\nIn a country that is incredibly prone to rapid change, the traditional roles of these amazing women may one day fade away.\nBut the stories of these women of the sea are sure to live on and inspire anyone who hears them.",
        "7": "《GEOLOGY: Jeju Island - The Gift of Volcanic Activity》\nEarly in August 2014, Typhoon Nakri dumped more than 1,000 mm of rain on Jeju Island.\nDespite the record amounts of rain, however, Korea's largest island did not suffer from much damage.\nExperts agreed that this was due to the unique geological structure of Jeju Island.\nAs Jeju is a volcanic island, the soil layers are evenly mixed with volcanic rock, volcanic ash, sand, and stone, and it allows rainwater to easily soak into the ground.\nApart from its soil, many other results of volcanic activity of the past can be seen across the island.\nTraces of volcanic activity can be clearly seen in Suwolbong.\nLocated on the southern part of the island, these rocks show multiple layers of soil caused by volcanic activity.\nBy looking closely, you can see where an underwater volcano erupted and pushed volcanic rock into the layers of the soil deposits.\nThis shows how strong the volcanic activity was.",
        "8": "Traces of volcanic activity are also apparent across the island on its walking trails called ollegil.\nWhile following ollegil, people can see various colors of soil ranging from black to red.\nBlack represents hyeonmuam made during the rapid cooling process of lava.\nRed soil is the outcome of volcanic rocks, ash, and underground gases.\nThe jusangjeolli cliffs on the southern coast of Jeju offer visitors a scenic view and are characteristic of the island.\nThe jusangjeolli cliffs are stone columns, which are 30-40 meters tall and extend for about 1 kilometer along the coast.\nThey are shaped like cubes of various sizes.\nThese were created when thick lava at about 1,000℃ flowed from the mouth of a volcano and cooled rapidly.\nOther unmissable evidence of volcanic activity on Jeju is 368 small volcanic mountains, known as oreum, and some 160 lava caves scattered under the ground.\nThese were created as a result of more than 100 volcanic eruptions around Mount Halla between 250,000 and 1.2 million years ago.\nThe island itself is a volcano museum."

        "1": "《A Meeting of the Minds》\nHost: Good evening! Welcome to Dream Time.\nEvery Friday, we invite four historical figures to share the wisdom that allowed them to make their remarkable achievements.\nToday, we have some great minds, including well-known inventors, a scholar, and the very first female Nobel prize winner joining us.\nPlease welcome our guests!\nLet's start by meeting two world-famous inventors, Jang Yeongsil from the Joseon period and Thomas Edison from the United States of America of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.\nBoth of you came up with a timely invention of necessary tools which brought a more convenient life to everyone.\nMr. Jang, how did you do it?",
        "2": "Jang Yeongsil: However difficult a task may have been, I just kept working until I found the answer.\nSince most people in Joseon engaged in agriculture, it was crucial to know the exact time and seasonal variations.\nHowever, the Chinese calendar, which was used in Joseon at that time, was not consistent with the time and seasons of the Joseon.\nThus I made such instruments as the honcheonui (a celestial globe) after observing the position of the Sun, the Moon, and the stars of the Joseon.\nI also kept thinking about how to make life easier for the people suffering from droughts and hunger, which was why I was able to invent the world's first rain measuring device, cheugugi, and Korea's first water-clock, jagyeongnu.\nHost: Given all the amazing inventions, no wonder you are called a pioneer of practical science in fifteenth century in Asia and beyond.\nJang Yeongsil: One more thing. Though I may have come from humble beginnings, I won fame as an inventor since I never gave up.\nKeep trying to succeed for a good cause as I did, and you will contribute to the advancement of technology.\nNow, Mr. Edison, could you please share your secrets of success with us?\nThomas Edison: You know the secret: give it your all, every time!\nI have more than 2,300 patents worldwide, which is why people rush to judge that I am simply a genius.\nBut, to be honest, I am not a genius.\nNone of my inventions came by accident.\nI wasn't the one who first invented the electric light bulb, but I made the existing light bulb last long enough to be used practically.\nWhat it boils down to is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.\nHost: What do you mean by that?\nThomas Edison: It means you should go through trial and error until you get what you want.\nFor example, in an attempt to find an affordable and efficient alternative for the material used in the previous bulb, I tried things from all over the world.\nI tried approximately 6,000 materials from various fibers like cotton to metals until I finally found the proper one from Japan, which enabled the bulb to stay alight more than 40 hours.\nIn the beginning, some things might seem impossible for you to achieve.\nHowever, you have to remember to try just one more time.\nThere is no replacement for hard work.",
        "3": "Host: It is highly desirable that people keep trying even after a failure. Thank you, Mr. Edison and Mr. Jang.\nWe will keep the value of hard work in mind.\nNow, the next guests are two people who kept their chin up in every hardship, Marie Curie and Jeong Yakyong.\nPlease give them a warm welcome!\nMs. Curie, you are the first and still the only female scientist ever who was awarded the Nobel prize in two different categories, physics and chemistry.\nDespite such outstanding success, I'm sure life was never easy for you, especially as an immigrant and a woman in the early 1900s.\nMarie Curie: That's right. I had to fight against gender inequality.\nAt that time, it was almost impossible for women to go to university.\nThus I had to leave my country, Poland, for Paris, which allowed me to pursue further studies.\nMost male scientists in France hesitated to accept me as one of their colleagues.\nHowever, nothing ever stopped me from studying, even in a male-oriented society.\nAs a result, I developed the theory of radioactivity and with my husband, Pierre, discovered the significant elements of radioactivity, polonium and radium.\nHost: Ms. Curie, your passion for research led to the medical use of X-rays through the \"Little Curies\" during World War I.\nCould you tell me about that?\nMarie Curie: The \"Little Curies\" were ambulances specially made for rapid operations on wounded soldiers.\nThere was a need to use X-rays in surgery near the front lines so I equipped the medical vehicles with X-ray devices and drove the \"Little Curies\" to the battle fields.\nI believe it is imperative that people share a general responsibility for humanity.\n《About X-rays》\nX-rays were accidentally discovered by German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1895.\nWhile experimenting with electrical currents, he noticed a type of radiation which could not be fully understood.\nSo he named this \"X-radiation.\"",
        "4": "Host: Had it not been for the \"Little Curies,\" countless lives would have been lost.\nI imagine such deep consideration for others is one of the secrets that brought you success.\nMr. Jeong, you had been sent away for a total of nineteen years due to political and religious reasons.\nEven so, how come you ended up with such influential academic achievements?\nJeong Yakyong: I try to see the good in everything.\nSuch a lengthy isolation gave me an opportunity to develop my silhak (practical learning) theories.\nMost of all, watching regular people's lives up close, I realized were it not for practical use, all knowledge would be meaningless.\nHost: What you just said reminds me of what President Kennedy of the United States said in our program last week.\n\"When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.\"\nSo what else led you to success?\nJeong Yakyong: Actually, my genuine affection for the people of Joseon was what made it possible for me to have some meaningful achievements.\nI truly cared about them, which was why I wrote books emphasizing the practical use of knowledge and technology.\nIn late Joseon, many people were suffering from poverty due to failing government policies and irresponsible officials.\nMoreover, many scholars thought little of the practical technologies which could have made life easier for those who were suffering.\nI thought it was highly desirable that people be treated equally regardless of their social status.\nWith this in mind, I wrote guidelines for government officials and principles to reform all the social and political systems.\nI hope that answers your question.\nHost: Thank you, Ms. Curie and Mr. Jeong, for sharing your wisdom, with which we can overcome the difficult situations we are facing now.\nWere it not for your pure desire to study and your deep consideration for others, none of us could enjoy what we have come to take for granted.\nThis is the end of this week's Dream Time. Thank you all.",
        "5": "《The Connection between Success and Luck》\nA survey of college students on the secrets of success revealed that \"luck\" was believed to be the most crucial factor for success.\nGiven a number of historical achievements that occurred by accident such as the discovery of X-rays, or the invention of the microwave, it is easy to think that luck has played a key role in success.\nIn particular, when it comes to art, many people believe that a person needs to be lucky and have a natural gift for art.\nHowever, as soon as people look into the stories behind all the great successes, it is easy to see that attributing success in art to mere luck is jumping to conclusions.\nStephen King, one of the best selling novelists of all time, once wrote \"Don't wait for the muse.\"\nThat is, to be a great writer, you cannot simply sit and wait to be inspired.\nInstead, you should do whatever keeps you motivated and inspired.\nIt is also important to remember that many of the great artists such as Vincent van Gogh had unfortunate lives and did not get the proper credit for their works before their death.\nEven so, they did not stop performing their art.\nTherefore, if you think that the reason you failed was because you were simply unlucky, consider how you prepared.\nAs the old saying goes, \"Luck favors the prepared.\""

        "2": "Title: Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups\nPurpose: to find out what makes a group more competent than others\nProcedure: 1. Measure 699 people's individual intelligence.\n2. Randomly assign the participants to groups.\n3. Ask them to work in groups to complete tasks. (e.g., puzzles, brainstorming, making moral judgements)\nThe results of the research showed that there are certain factors that differentiated groups with high group intelligence from those with low group intelligence.\nMost importantly, these factors enabled effective communication, creating a motivating atmosphere.\nFirst, teams with higher group intelligence demonstrated a more equal distribution of conversational turn-taking.\nIn other words, in these groups certain individuals did not dominate conversations and everyone contributed equally to the discussion.\nSecond, members of these groups scored well on a test called \"Reading the Mind,\" which measures how well people can read complex emotional states from people's faces.\nThese people were socially sensitive enough to sense people's feelings during a discussion.\nThis discovery led to the conclusion that when groups of such socially sensitive people worked together and were given equal opportunities to contribute, team members were more motivated to freely exchange ideas and appreciate other opinions, which guaranteed the team's success.",
        "3": "What boosts the impact of communication on a group's achievement is interdisciplinarity, or how diverse the group members are.\nInterdisciplinary groups are groups whose members specialize in a variety of fields of study.\nThese groups tend to accomplish more than a group of just scientists or a group of only artists by mixing the best of the various fields.\nSteve Jobs was very well aware of the importance of communication among experts from various fields.\nHe believed that the best work is created when people from different fields are connected together and when people with different backgrounds and knowledge encourage each other to think out of the box.\nHe claimed that without such interaction, success would be very difficult to achieve.\nThis very philosophy was reflected in the design of his animation studio.\nThe original architectural plan called for three buildings, with separate offices for the computer scientists, the animators, and the CEOs.\nHowever, in order to encourage interaction among the employees, Jobs insisted that a single building be constructed with an airy space at its center.\nThe purpose of creating this empty hall was to force the computer programmers and animators to collaborate and exchange ideas freely.\nThat emphasis on communication, even though it came at the expense of convenience, was met with an unbelievable result: every one of the studio's animations has been a commercial success, with an average international profit of more than $550 million per animation from 1995 to 2011.",
        "4": "Communication among people with various backgrounds is especially necessary in the digital era, where it is almost impossible to be knowledgeable in more than one field due to the rapid expansion and changes in each field.\nWhen individuals' interdisciplinary knowledge is collected together, it becomes much more powerful than an encyclopedia written by a handful of experts.\nWhen such intelligence is brought together, it is called \"collective intelligence.\"\nAlthough it has long been around us in many different forms, the Internet has created a new form of collective intelligence.\nThanks to the Internet, knowledge and opinions have become very easy to share nowadays.\nPeople post what they know or how they feel about certain things on open pages, and not only can others look at these posts but they can also leave comments on them.\nSuch active online communication of opinions and knowledge can sometimes be more accurate and meaningful than the opinion of one single expert.",
        "5": "To sum up, many people mistakenly believe that highly capable individuals automatically make ideal group members.\nHowever, a number of studies have demonstrated that this is not necessarily true.\nWhat determines a group's success is communication rather than individual intelligence.\nWhen people care about other people's feelings and make sure that everyone participates evenly, their interaction is bound to produce a good result.\nFurthermore, connections between people with various kinds of knowledge ensure creative innovation and an unimaginable range of information.\nWe always need geniuses. And we do benefit from experts working together.\nHowever, we should be aware that a group of average people with diverse backgrounds who are willing to communicate is as important as, if not more than, the superstars.",

        "1": "《Can You Find the Mathematics in Classical Music?》\nGood morning! When I was invited to your high school to give a special lecture on music and mathematics, I was thrilled.\nI am a strong advocate of the positive effects of classical music.\nDuring my class, classical music is always in the background.\nI'm aware that sometimes this induces some of my students to sleep, but nevertheless I still think the benefits outweigh the costs when it comes to listening to classical music.\nAre you ready to dive into the adventures of classical music?\nI know, I know, classical music is sometimes seen as a dull subject, but give me a few minutes of your attention and you'll be sorry you judged classical music so quickly.\nFirst, how many of you like math?\nIt's good to see that at least half of you enjoy my field.\nDid you know that there is a remarkable connection between mathematics and classical music?\nIt is a well-known fact that famous composers such as Bach and Beethoven used mathematics when composing their masterpieces.\nThis is not an exaggeration. Let me explain this relationship.\nDon't worry, I won't scare you with the complicated details.",
        "2": "I'm sure even a ten-year-old knows the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), and also that he was going deaf in his final years.\nSo have you ever thought about how Beethoven managed to compose uplifting compositions such as the Moonlight Sonata and Ode to Joy while he was deaf?\nThe answer is rather simple; it's mathematics.\nBeethoven said, \"I always have a picture in my mind when composing and I follow its lines.\"\nWhen Beethoven said he pictured musical pieces in his mind, it means that he was able to visualize the equation of the musical harmonies, and thus he was able to compose music.\nBeethoven's emotion and creativity with the certainty of mathematics aided him in composing great scores while he was going deaf.\nBeethoven's true genius lay not only in his ability to see the patterns without hearing the music, but to feel their effect.",
        "3": "Take a look at this music score of the familiar Canon in D major by Johann Pachelbel.\nDid you notice that there are three violins? Look at the score carefully.\nDo you see how in all three rows the music notes are all different?\nYet, there is repetition! That's where mathematics is involved!\nThis is an excellent example of counterpoint and polyphony.\nIf you look at the musical patterns carefully, they show three different melodies being played together.\nJohann Sebastian Bach, a composer that everyone knows, would later become famous for applying these principles very well.\nHis compositions are grounded in mathematical concepts.\nNow, listen carefully. It's going to seem a little difficult, but I'll guide you through it.\nBach was an expert on counterpoint, which is when two or more combinations of melodies are played together.\nHe was also skilled in polyphony, literally meaning \"many sounds.\"\nWhen these two different musical patterns rooted in mathematics are combined together they produce a beautiful composition.\nIsn't this collaboration of mathematics and music astonishing?",
        "4": "Now that we've talked about how composers were affected by mathematics, you may ask, whether there's ever been a case where a mathematician was influenced by music.\nThe answer lies in my next story.\nHas anyone heard of the theory of relativity?\nI can hear some of you whispering probably the most famous physicist of all.\nYes! You're right! It's Einstein!\nHe even once said, \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.\nI often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.\"\nEinstein, who was also an experienced pianist and violinist, would often take comfort in music.\nOnce, while concentrating deeply on a mathematical problem, he would play the piano for a while.\nThis routine actually continued for about two weeks, and at the end he emerged with the first working draft of the theory of general relativity!\nAs a mathematician myself, I believe that it's significant that someone such as Einstein who had such strong abilities in numbers and logic, kept music so close to his heart.",
        "5": "Other leading mathematicians such as Pythagoras also shared a passion for music.\n\"There is geometry in the humming of the strings. There is music in the spacing of the spheres.\"\nPythagoras was considered the \"Father of Music and Harmonics.\"\nHe applied harmonics to everything from music, art, and even architecture.\nIn this picture, you can see the music theory Pythagoras developed.\nThe numbers on the bells and the cups represent intervals and harmonic frequencies.\nImagine a music composition with constant melodies being played without any breaks.\nWouldn't that sound rather tiring?\nThanks to Pythagoras, we don't have to put our ears through that.",
        "6": "Music is not just learning about notes and rhythms and math is not only composed of arithmetic and counting.\nMathematics and music are both about learning structure and pattern.\nFinally, have you ever thought about why mathematicians have been so drawn to music?\nIt may be due to something called alpha waves.\nThese are brain waves that help you focus in a relaxed state.\nAlpha waves are often produced by Baroque music, which refers to compositions by Bach, Handel or Teleman.\nThis kind of music aids deep concentration in the alpha brain wave state.\nAlpha waves are effective for learning vocabulary, memorizing facts and reading.\nLet's make that connection back to mathematicians.\nMathematics is a field that requires high concentration.\nTherefore classical music, especially Baroque music, can help with that.\nBefore I step off the podium, I have one last question:\nWhy not give classical music a chance?\nThank you for listening."

Maintaining good posture also does wonders for your appearance.\nHave you ever gotten an unfavorable impression of someone, even before he or she has said or done anything?\nHe or she probably just had bad posture.\nIt is the opposite for people with good posture.\nThey not only look taller, but also more attractive and even smarter.",
        "5": "3. Good posture is also good for your self-confidence.\nAmy Cuddy, a social psychologist, recommends what she calls the \"Wonder Woman\" pose.\nIn this pose, you stand with your feet apart, your hands on your hips, and your chin lifted.\nShe has found that this pose helps increase feelings of power and decrease feelings of anxiety.\nShe suggests doing this pose for two minutes before a presentation or interview to help increase your confidence and your ability to handle stress.\nGood posture doesn't just display your confidence — it can actually produce it!\n4. Last but not least, good posture can help improve your concentration and memory.\nKeeping your posture upright helps open up your airways, allowing more oxygen to flow through your lungs.\nYour blood is then able to carry sufficient oxygen to your whole body.\nThis helps your nervous system, organs, and other tissues function more effectively.\nSo good posture naturally enables you to breathe properly, and this can enhance your mental function.",
        "6": "《MIND YOUR POSTURE》\nNow stop and check your posture!\nHow are you sitting? Are you slouched over or sitting upright?\nWe have seen several benefits of good posture.\nTo take advantage of these benefits, you should make good posture a part of your everyday life.\nOne way to do this is to imagine that a string coming from the top of your head is pulling you gently up towards the ceiling.\nTry practicing this for a few minutes each day.\nGood posture doesn't happen overnight; it is a gradual process.\nBut the good news is that it is never too late to start.\nWith consistent effort, you can improve your posture.\nYou might just improve your overall quality of life, too!"

        "2": "《Sunday painter》\nRousseau was born in the town of Laval, in France's Loire Valley.\nAfter the death of his father in 1868, he moved to Paris to support his widowed mother.\nHe got a job as a toll collector in 1871.\nIt was at this time that he started to paint in his spare time as a hobby.\nHe never received formal training.\nHe taught himself to paint by copying paintings in the art museums of Paris or by sketching in the city's botanical gardens and the National Museum of Natural History.\nRousseau openly claimed that he had \"no teacher other than nature.\"\nBeing a self-taught painter, Rousseau developed a highly personal style with an absence of correct proportions, a flat perspective, and the use of sharp, often unnatural, colors.\nHis portraits and landscapes often have a childlike, \"naive\" quality, and some of his paintings look like scenes out of dreams.\nIn 1893, at the age of 49, Rousseau retired from his job as a toll collector, and started to paint full time.\nNevertheless, he became widely known by the nickname of Le Douanier (the customs officer), a reference to his old job.",
        "3": "《Jungle-themed paintings》\nRousseau is best known for his jungle-themed paintings even though he never saw a jungle, or even left France.\nHis knowledge of tropical plants and animals came mainly from the botanical gardens and zoos of Paris, as well as from academic sculptures and wildlife pictures.\nRousseau once described his frequent visits to the botanical gardens as follows: \"When I go into the glasshouses and I see the strange plants of exotic lands, it seems to me that I enter a dream.\"\nHe also met with soldiers who had fought in the jungles of Mexico, and he listened to the stories of these men to gain inspiration for his jungle paintings.",
        "4": "His first jungle-themed work was Tiger in a Tropical Storm, which shows a tiger preparing to jump on its prey in the middle of a raging thunderstorm.\nIt was exhibited in 1891, and resulted in Rousseau's first serious review.\nFélix Vallotton, a fellow artist and critic, wrote: \"His tiger surprising its prey ought not to be missed; it's the alpha and omega of painting.\"\nHowever, the uniqueness of Rousseau's style — the exaggerated scale, simplified forms, and blocks of vivid color — provoked mixed reactions.\nDespite the positive response to the painting from Vallotton, it was over a decade before Rousseau returned to the jungle as a major theme.",
        "5": "By 1905, his reputation had grown sufficiently to exhibit The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope.\nThis painting features a jungle scene lit by a deep red setting sun.\nIn the foreground, a lion bites deeply into the neck of an antelope.\nOther animals are visible in the thick forest: a panther watches from the right, and an owl stares out of the background in the center, with a second bird and a dark ape-like shape to the left.\nRousseau based the central pair of animals on a stuffed animal display in the National Museum of Natural History.\nRousseau painted more than 25 pieces with jungle themes.\nAlthough his paintings seemed simple at first glance, they were built up carefully in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the richness of the jungle.\nHe also devised his own method for depicting rain by trailing strings of silver paint diagonally across the canvas.\nThis technique inspired later artists.",
        "6": "《Recognition of a genius》\nRousseau's work earned the admiration of modern artists including Pablo Picasso.\nWhen Picasso happened upon a painting by Rousseau, the younger artist instantly recognized Rousseau's genius.\nIn 1908, Picasso held a party to honor Rousseau and his work.\nHowever, in spite of his popularity among his fellow artists, Rousseau continued to be seen as a figure of amusement in the art world.\nIt was only after his death in 1910, at the age of 66, that the name Henri Rousseau became famous.\nAlthough Rousseau took up art as a hobby, he managed to make his way to the top.\nToday, he is known as one of the greatest \"naive art\" painters."

Come and play with me!\"\nSo he played with that child the whole day long, and they were merry.\nThe sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the leaves were so green, and they saw so many butterflies, that everything was beautiful.\nThis was in fine weather.\nWhen it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops and to smell the fresh scents.\nWhen it blew, they loved to listen to the rushing wind, driving the clouds before it, and making the sea roar in fury.\nBut when it snowed, that was best of all; for they liked nothing so much as to look up at the white flakes falling, and to listen to the silence upon the paths.\nBut one day, of a sudden, the traveler lost the child.\nHe called over and over again, but got no answer.\nSo he went back to the road and went on for a while without meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy.\nHe asked the boy, \"What do you do here?\"\nAnd the boy replied, \"I am always learning.

Come and love with me.\"\nSo he went away with that young man, and they met one of the prettiest girls that ever was seen.\nSo the young man fell in love directly.\nThey quarreled sometimes and they made up.\nThey wrote letters and were always looking out for one another.\nThey were engaged at Christmas time, and were going to be married soon.",

Come and be busy with me!\"\nSo he became very busy with that gentleman, and they went on their journey through the woods together.\nThe woods had been open and green at first, like woods in spring, but now they began to be thick and dark, like woods in summer.\nSome of the trees were even turning brown.\nThe gentleman was not alone.\nHe had a lady with him, who was his wife; and they had children with them, too.\nThey all went through the woods, cutting down trees, making a path through the branches, and working hard.",

Then they all went on together.\nSometimes they came to several avenues at once, and then they all stood still.\nOne of the children said, \"Father, I am going to sea,\" and another said, \"Father, I am going to India.\"\nAnother said, \"Father, I am going to seek my fortune where I can,\" and another said, \"Father, I am going to Heaven!\"\nWith many tears at parting, each child went on its way; and the child who went to Heaven rose into the golden air and vanished.\nWhenever these partings happened, the traveler looked at the gentleman and saw him glance up at the sky, where the day was beginning to decline, and the sunset to come on.\nHe saw, too, that his hair was turning grey.\nBut they could not rest for long, for they had to continue on their journey.",

The sunset is very near. I pray not yet!\"\nBut the voice cried, \"Mother, mother!\" not minding him, though his hair was now quite white, and tears were on his face.\nThen the mother, who was already drawn into the shade of the dark avenue, kissed him, and said, \"My dearest, I am called!\"\nAnd she was gone.

Come and remember with me!\"",

        "5": "Spices made food taste good, leading to an era of exploration and discovery.\nWith demand for spices growing in the early 15th century Europe, many explorers began long sea voyages in search of spices, which lasted for about 200 years.\nColumbus from Italy ended up going west to the Americas; Da Gama from Portugal discovered the first sea route to India; and Magellan from Portugal went east and was the first to sail around the world.\nOn land, the Silk Road carried spices and many other trade goods between Asia and the Middle East.\nA search for ways to make food taste better sparked a global trade network which many historians agree eventually resulted in intellectual and cultural exchange, diplomacy, conflict, and wealth.\nWhen Christopher Columbus arrived in the Bahamas, southeast of Florida, he believed it was a part of India.\nLater, people used the term West Indies to differentiate the region from the real India.",
        "6": "For example, pepper is a very common spice all over the world today; however, an ancient Roman cook could not just go to the grocery store to get some.\nThe Romans had a flourishing spice trade with India, but acquiring pepper was difficult and costly, leading to myths about how dangerous it was to harvest.\nIn fact, some stories said that pepper trees in India were protected by poisonous snakes.\nThey had to be scared away by burning the trees, which gave the peppercorn its black color.\nThese kinds of fantastic stories maintained the charm of the spice, and they also enabled pepper investors to strengthen their hold on the prized commodity.",
        "7": "Technological progress, human curiosity, and the determination to explore moved people all over the world.\nThis movement of people also meant that more and more people from different backgrounds would come together.\nThe tasty history of food also includes what happens when cuisine and culture intertwine.\nThe story of pizza reveals how food evolves over time because of the creativity of people.\nTomatoes were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, but many Europeans believed them to be poisonous.\nSome poor people in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century, maybe out of curiosity or necessity, began to use tomatoes as a bread topping.\nIt tasted good, so tourists were attracted to the area to try this specialty.\nThis was probably how pizza was born.\nImmigration in the 19th century brought pizza to the United States and Canada, increasing its popularity and sparking the creation of regional recipes like Chicago deep dish or New York pizza.",
        "8": "Food gives strength, helps people fight, and evolves over time.\nIt is also an intriguing way to learn about history.\nWith the world becoming a smaller place and more and more varieties of foods being invented, it's no wonder that many people take vacations where the focus is on their stomachs.\nWhen they try a local dish for the first time, they feel an intimate connection with the unique history of that particular place.\nFood: what a wonderful, tasty way to learn about people and the history of the world.",
        "9": "《A Brief, Beautiful Moment》\nWar might seem like a time for hate and conflict.\nHowever, even during the darkest of times, there is still room for charity and humanity.\nWe see this in the story of Elisabeth Vincken, who made a decision that warmed the hearts of sworn enemies during a time of war.\nOn Christmas Eve, 1944, German and American soldiers fought in one of the biggest battles of World War II near the town of Aachen, Germany.\nWith the safety of her family being put at risk by remaining in the city, Elisabeth Vincken and her son decided to take shelter in a small cabin in the woods.\nElisabeth waited for her husband to return from work as she prepared a simple Christmas dinner of roast chicken and potatoes.\nWhen the sun went down, there was a knock at the door.\nElisabeth opened the door to find three American soldiers, one badly wounded.\nThey asked if they could come in, and Elisabeth politely invited them in to the warmth of the cabin despite the fact that they were enemy soldiers.\nThey were in need, and she was a charitable person.",
        "10": "Suddenly there was another knock at the door: it was four German soldiers.\nThe thought that she might be jailed for harboring enemy soldiers came to mind, but she calmly explained that the Americans were desperate and it was Christmas Eve, so she took them in.\nOne German soldier stared intently and then finally said, \"It's Christmas. There will be no shooting here.\"\nThat Christmas Eve, enemy soldiers gathered together and shared a meal.\nIn the morning, they thanked the woman for her kindness and courage, picked up their guns, and returned to the war.\nThe brief, beautiful moment of peace in the middle of that chaos was over."

I'll give you one minute to put your handicaps back on. Or you will all die.\"",

        "1": "《Money and Its Many Meanings》\nWhen people are asked what they value most in their lives, their answers vary.\nMost say that leading a healthy life is high on their list of priorities.\nAlso, many say that having a job they love is of extreme importance.\nBut what about making money?\nHow important is it in your life?\nTo properly answer this question, you may need to know the true meaning of money.\nThe following three stories highlight various meanings of money.\n《Rai of Yap》\nThe island of Yap, located in the Pacific Ocean between Guam and Palau, had been untouched by modern civilization until the 1800s.\nYou may think that they shouldn't have had their own monetary system because they were not modernized.\nHowever, the people of Yap had a very advanced and well developed system of money.\nThey used rai ― large, thick round stone wheels with a hole cut in the middle in which they could insert a pole to help transport them.\nSome rai were very big and weighed about 7 tons!",
        "2": "These huge stones were not native to the island.\nInstead, they were mined on the Palau Islands, 460 km away from Yap.\nBecause Yap islanders used narrow boats, the stones often fell overboard and got lost in the sea.\nWhat is interesting is that even when rai fell into the sea, people agreed that the incident didn't change either the value of the stone or its owner's ownership.\nHow this system could even work may seem really strange.\nBut in fact we have a very similar system today.\nOur cash in the bank is just like the rai that lay underwater.\nThough we can't see cash in the bank, it works perfectly as money.\nAfter all, our monetary system is based on credit, just like the rai of Yap.",
        "3": "《Money That Saved a Town》\nIn 1932, in the middle of the Great Depression, the town of Wörgl, Austria, was suffering from a 35% unemployment rate.\nThe town's mayor had a long list of projects to do and only 40,000 Austrian shillings in the bank to pay for them.\nThinking the depression was caused by lack of money circulation, he decided to issue 40,000 shillings worth of Freigeld, a regional currency.\nThen, the mayor began to use Freigeld to pay for his projects.\nFreigeld, which means \"free money,\" was different from normal money in that it depreciated monthly by 1% of its original value.\nTo maintain its original value, people had to buy a stamp that was worth the amount of devaluation and put it on their Freigeld.\nThe purpose of this strange system was to accelerate the circulation of money, and it succeeded!\nEverybody who was paid in Freigeld spent it as quickly as possible because keeping the currency, and not spending it, meant losing wealth.\nThe average speed that money circulated increased by fourteen times, which consequently revived the economy of the town.\nIn less than two years, Wörgl became the first town in Austria to reach full employment.\nThe experiment in the small town of Wörgl might suggest that money, as the medium of exchange, should be circulated appropriately, and that its smooth flow helps to vitalize the economy.",
        "4": "《The Power of $25》\nIf someone asked you whether 25 dollars was a little or a lot of money, what would you say?\nTo answer this question, imagine what you could do with 25 dollars.\nFor example, you and your friends could watch a movie.\nHowever, do you know that the same amount of money that you spend on simple entertainment could be used completely differently for people on the other side of the planet?\nAfter retiring from the police force, Steve and Anna Tolan moved to Zambia and set up a charitable organization that provides conservation education programs for children.\nSince it is a nonprofit organization, they rely on financial donations to keep the organization running.\nWith 25 dollars, the Tolans could pay for one of the following:\n• a full school uniform for a student\n• two 25 kilogram bags of corn (the staple food), which is enough to feed a family of six for a month\n• two good quality blankets (most children in Zambia don't have one)\n• four mosquito nets to help prevent malaria\nIsn't that amazing?\nThat's possible because the value of money is relative, just as Gulliver is little in the land of giants and huge in the land of tiny people.\nThe same amount of money may have different meanings to different people.\nTherefore, take some time and think about how to spend your money more meaningfully.",

Yes, a house.\nKyle MacDonald, a young man from Canada, started with a red paper clip and traded it for bigger and better things until he owned a house.\nHis inspiration was his childhood game: Bigger, Better.\nInstead of getting a job to buy a house, he decided to make use of the red paper clip on his desk and trade it up to a house.\nOn July 12th, 2005, MacDonald posted a picture of a red paper clip on his blog and asked whether anyone wanted to make a trade for something bigger or better.\nA few days later, Rhawnie and Corinna from Vancouver called him up and offered to trade a pen shaped like a fish for the paper clip.\nRhawnie and Corinna were vegetarians and didn't want to use a pen shaped like a fish.\nHowever, they did a lot of paper work, so they needed a lot of paper clips.\nSo, exchanging their pen for a pretty red paper clip was a win-win situation.",
        "6": "That's how the first exchange took place.\nMacDonald traded the red paper clip for a fish-shaped pen.\nThen, he traded the pen for a doorknob.\nHe kept trading for something bigger or better.\nMacDonald made 14 trades and finally wound up with a house located at 503 Main Street in Kipling, Saskatchewan.\nThe whole sequence of his trades was as below.\nOne simple red paper clip A fish-shaped pen A hand-sculpted doorknob A camping stove A portable generator A party kit A used snowmobile Two tickets to the Rocky Mountains A cube van A recording contract One year's rent in Arizona A day with rocker Alice Cooper A snow globe An acting role in a movie A two-story house in Kipling, Saskatchewan",

        "3": "Forced perspective has been extensively used not only in photography but also in movie making.\nFor example, the technique can be used in an action or adventure movie scene where dinosaurs are threatening the heroes.\nBy placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera, the dinosaur may be made to look monstrously tall to the viewer, even though it is just closer to the camera.\nSo you don't have to scream like a little kid while watching a scary movie in a packed theater.\nJust remember that the gigantic monster on the screen may only be a little plastic toy, and that, using forced perspective, the movie makers turned it into something frightening to the audience.",
        "4": "There are also cases in some movies where characters need to be of varying sizes.\nThe same technique of forced perspective may be applied:\nA person intended to be larger will be closer to the camera, while a person meant to be smaller will be farther from the camera.\nThen, it is shot at such an angle that it appears they are next to each other and that one of them is really big and the other really small.\nThis sounds simple, until you realize that you need to build a set on which the actors can interact at the same time, while hiding the fact that they're far away from each other.",

Can you put the fish in the fishbowl?\nStare at the yellow stripe in the middle of the fish for about 10-20 seconds.\nThen, move your gaze to the fishbowl.\nQ2. Have a look at the squares.\nAre the squares inside the blue and yellow squares all the same color?\nQ3. Stare at the circles for a few seconds.\nAre the circles moving or not moving?\nIf they are moving, are they moving fast or slow?\nQ4.

        "8": "《Answers and explanations》\nCompare and contrast your answers with the ones below, and learn about what was going on in your brain while you experienced each of these illusions.\n1. Afterimage\nIf you saw a different colored fish in the bowl, you experienced an afterimage.\nIn your eyes, there are three types of color receptors that are most sensitive to either red, blue, or green.\nWhen you stare at a particular color for a long time, these receptors get tired.\nWhen you then look at a different background, the receptors that are tired do not work as well.\nTherefore, the information from the different color receptors is not in balance.\nThis will create the color \"afterimages.\"\n2. The Bezold Effect\nThe smaller squares inside the blue and yellow squares are all the same color.\nThey seem different because a color is perceived differently depending on its relation to its neighboring colors (here, blue or yellow, depending on the outer square).\n3. Illusory Motion\nThe circles appear to be moving even though they are not.\nThis is due to the effects of interacting color contrasts and shape position.\nThe circles could seem to be moving slow to some people, or fast to others.\n4. Subjective Contour\nIt is tricky, isn't it?\nThe artist drew an elephant with only legs and no feet, and then he also drew feet without legs.\nThis resulted in the illusion that the elephant has more than four legs.\nThis picture contains some subjective contours, such as the Kanizsa Triangle on the right:\nA triangle (pointing down) can be seen in this figure even though no triangle is actually drawn.\nThis effect is known as a subjective contour.\nThe contour of the triangle is created by the shapes around it."

To Plug in or Not?》\nImagine scientists have come up with an amazing new invention called the Experience Machine.\nIt works like this: You go into a lab and sit down with the staff and tell them about everything you've ever wanted to do in life.\nThen, you put on some gear that connects to the machine and go into a tank of fluid.\nThe scientists induce you into a coma that you will never awaken from.\nThe machine will stimulate your brain, and you'll think and feel that you are doing the things that you have always desired.\nThis allows you to have whatever experiences you want for the duration of your life.\nIn this virtual reality, you are happy.",
        "2": "Of course, you wouldn't know that you were in the tank you'd think that everything was all actually happening.\nMaybe you wouldn't have a good reason to deny something substantially better than reality ― even if it was \"artificial.\"\nBut what about human dignity?\nAnd the satisfaction of our \"true\" desires?\nThe truth is that you would just be floating in a tank filled with fluid.\nIf the Experience Machine was available to you and guaranteed to work flawlessly, would you plug into it for life, pre-programming your life experiences?",
        "3": "《2. To Help or Not to Help?》\nThomas Nagel is a famed professor of philosophy at New York University.\nHe addresses issues of noninterference and the meaningfulness of life in a story.\nOne day, he noticed a little spider living in the urinal of the restroom at Princeton University, where he was teaching.\n\"The spider appeared to have an awful life, living in a smelly and dirty place. He didn't seem to like it.\nWhenever I went to the restroom, the spider seemed to try to scramble out of the way.\nOften, he would get caught, fall, and get soaked by the flushing water.\nThe worst part was that there was no way for the spider to get out and no way to tell if he even wanted to.\nNone of the other students or professors did anything to alter the situation.\nOne day toward the end of the term, I took a paper towel from the wall dispenser and extended it to him.\nHis legs grasped the end of the towel, and I lifted him out and placed him on the floor.\nHe just sat there, not moving a muscle.\nI nudged him to go anywhere he wanted.\"",

Who Dives First?》\nThere is a penguin living in Antarctica with his friends.\nThey're completely surrounded by snow and ice.\nIt is really hard for the penguin and his friends to find food, and quite literally they are starving.\nFor survival, they must jump into the sea and hunt for fish.\nBut the penguin hesitates and says to himself, \"I'm so scared. The sea is full of dangers!\"\nIt's true. There might be a huge killer whale in the sea, which no doubt would be very dangerous.\nIn fact, all the other penguins think the same thing, and they also wait to dive into the water until others safely do it.\nThe penguin gets more and more hungry.\nUnless he or one of his friends gathers the courage to jump, the situation will worsen.\nIf you were the penguin, what would you do?\nWould you summon up the courage and become the first diver?\nOr would you keep waiting for others to jump into the sea first?\nHow would you react in each of the three dilemmatic situations?\nAnswering this question is not so easy.\nIn your personal life, you probably encounter similar situations.\nIn these situations, where you have to make tough decisions, try to step back and think things through.\nThis will help you make wiser decisions.",
        "6": "《The Story of Two Pebbles》\nMany years ago in a small Chinese village, a farmer called Feng had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to a village moneylender.\nThe moneylender, who was old and ugly, was in love with the farmer's beautiful daughter, Mei.\nSo he proposed a bargain.\nHe said he would forgive Feng's debt if he could marry his daughter.\nBoth the farmer and his daughter were frightened by the proposal.\nSo the moneylender suggested that they let fate decide the matter.\nHe told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag.\nThen, Mei would have to pick one pebble from the bag.\n- If Mei picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her father's debt would be forgiven.\n- If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven.\n- But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown in jail.",
        "7": "Without any good options, Feng and his daughter accepted the moneylender's proposal.\nThey all went to a pebble-scattered path in Feng's field.\nAs they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles.\nAs he picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag.\nHe then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag.\nNow, imagine that you were standing in the field.\nWhat would you have done if you were the girl?\nIf you had to advise her, what would you tell her?\n- Mei should refuse to pick a pebble.\n- Mei should say she saw the moneylender put two black pebbles in the bag.\n- Mei should pick a pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment.",
        "8": "What would you recommend Mei to do?\nWell, here is what she did.\nMei put her hand into the bag and took out a pebble.\nWithout looking at it, she let it fall onto the pebble-scattered path, where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles.\n\"Oh, how careless I am,\" Mei said.\n\"But never mind, if you look in the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\"\nSince the remaining pebble was black, it had to be assumed that she had picked the white one.\nAnd since the moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed like an unavoidably negative situation into an extremely positive one."

        "1": "《Towards a Softer World: YARN BOMBING》\nGood evening. My name is Magda Sayeg.\nI'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.\nHave you heard of yarn bombing?\nIt is taking knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment.\nYou may think that it's similar to graffiti.\nUnlike graffiti, however, yarn bombing doesn't damage structures or the natural landscape.\nIt is also temporary and removable.\nSome people worry that yarn bombing is not legal.\nThat's technically true, but no one has ever given me any trouble because yarn bombs look very innocent.\nBesides, most artists today do yarn installations with permission from property owners or even at their request.\nWhen I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious ideas about it, and I had no grand expectations.\nAll I wanted to see was something warm, fuzzy, and human on the cold gray steel things that I looked at every day.\nSo I wrapped a door handle.\nI call this the Alpha Piece.\nLittle did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.",
        "2": "People's reactions were great.\nIt intrigued me and I thought, \"What else could I do? Could I do something in public that would get the same reaction?\"\nSo I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.\nThe reaction was wild.\nPeople would park their cars, get out of their cars, stare at it, and take pictures of it.\nI was really excited and I wrapped every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.\nAnd the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.\nThis was the point when I became fascinated by yarn bombing.\nI found my new passion, and the urban environment was my playground.\nI was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the boring, even the ugly.\nAnd I tried not to take away its identity or its functionality but to give it a well tailored suit out of knitting.\nThis was fun for me.\nIt was really enjoyable to take boring objects and make them come to life.\nI could have laughed and let it pass, but I didn't.\nI wanted to take it seriously.\nI wanted to analyze it.\nI wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, and why other people were reacting so strongly to it.\nAnd I realized something.\nWe all live in this fast paced world, but we still crave something that's relatable.\nI think we've all become dull by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, traffic signs, advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff any more.\nSo when you come across a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting, which seems so out of place, you gradually weirdly? find a connection to it.\nThat is the moment.\nThat is the moment I love, and that is the moment I love to share with others.",
        "3": "So at this point, my curiosity grew.\nIt went from decorating the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to thinking about what else I could do with this material.\nCould I do something large-scale and more widespread?\nThat's when the double-decker bus project happened.\nThis changed everything for me.\nUp to that point, I hadn't wrapped anything so big in knitting.\nI spent many weeks collecting materials, and then took all the materials to London.\nI was given only three days to finish the project.\nIt was very stressful, but I was able to finish it.\nThe result was really satisfying.",
        "4": "Suddenly, I began witnessing something interesting:\nPeople from all over the world started yarn bombing.\nIt had reached global status.\nThough I started it, I certainly don't own it any more.\nAnd I know this because I have traveled to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and have stumbled upon stop sign poles that were wrapped up.\nThese experiences have shown me the hidden power of this craft and have revealed that there is a common language I have with the rest of the world.\nIt was through this common hobby that I found a connection with people whom I never thought I'd have one with.\nSo as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most ordinary places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.\nIf you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing — building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals — it's funny that most of the time we're just holding a remote control or a cell phone.\nAnd I'm totally guilty of this as well.\nBut what would happen if you put those things down?\nWhat would you make?\nWhat would you create with your own hands?",
        "5": "People may have thought I was a master knitter when I began yarn bombing, but I actually had no idea how to knit.\nNonetheless, I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before.\nI wasn't \"supposed to be\" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this.\nI majored in math actually.\nSo I didn't think I'd ever do this, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon it.\nAnd when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it, and I'm proud to say that I'm a working artist today.\nSo as you ponder your future, remember that it might not be so seamless.\nAnd one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever. Thank you.",
        "6": "《NEW TYPES OF GRAFFITI》\nIf you thought graffiti was limited to spray paint, think again.\n《REVERSE GRAFFITI》\nThere's hardly a kid who hasn't drawn something onto a dirty car window.\nWe all have done it.\nSometimes we wrote short messages with simple pictures, such as smiley faces, flowers, or puppies.\nHowever, we probably didn't know that we were actually doing a type of street art called reverse graffiti.\nReverse graffiti is the generic term for creating temporary images on walls or other surfaces by removing a layer of dirt from the surface.\nThis is also known as clean graffiti.\nIt is perhaps the most environmentally conscious form of street art, as well as the most temporary.\nIts artistic tools are cleaning supplies such as water, soap, pressure cleaners, and sometimes even fingers!",
        "7": "《MOSS GRAFFITI》\nAs people become more environmentally aware, the idea of making living, breathing graffiti has become an exciting outlet for graffiti artists.\nOne of those ideas is moss graffiti, also called eco-graffiti or green graffiti.\nMoss graffiti replaces spray paint, paint-markers, or other such toxic chemicals and paints with a paintbrush and \"moss paint\" that can grow on its own.\nIt can also be considered another form of guerrilla gardening.\nThe steps of making moss graffiti are as follows.\nFirst, gather up as much moss as you can find or buy.\nSecond, wash the moss to get as much soil out of the roots as possible.\nThird, make the \"moss paint.\"\nYou can make it by mixing water, yogurt, and sugar with the moss.\nFourth, pour the mixture into a bucket.\nFifth, use a paintbrush to apply the moss paint to the surface on which you wish your design to grow.\nThen, wait and watch your moss graffiti grow!\nGather up moss.\n‣ Wash the moss.\n‣ Make the moss paint.\n‣ Pour the moss paint.\n‣ Apply the moss paint to a wall.\n‣ Wait and watch!"

        "1": "《Symbolism in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz》\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz was written by the American author L. Frank Baum.\nIt tells the story of Dorothy, a young girl, who ends up in a tornado and gets carried from her Kansas farm home to an unknown land, Oz.\nAfter Dorothy's house falls on and accidentally kills the Wicked Witch of the East in Munchkin Land, Dorothy is welcomed to her new land by the Munchkins because she freed them from the bondage of the witch.\nThe Good Witch of the South, Glinda, then explains to Dorothy that in order to get back home, she needs to follow the Yellow Brick Road to reach the Emerald City.\nThere, she needs to ask the Wizard of Oz how to get back home to Kansas.\nOn her way down the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy meets some new friends, who all have something to ask the great wizard.\nHowever, when they finally get to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, they discover he is just a liar and that everything they have been searching for can be found within themselves.\nHaving been frequently dramatized into movies and musicals, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the best known classics among children and adults alike.\nHowever, it is not just an entertaining story.\nThere are many symbols in it to think about.\nHere are some intriguing examples.",
        "2": "First, take a close look at the title, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\nOz here is not just a simple name of a place, but the abbreviation for ounce, a measure for gold and silver.\nAnd this interpretation may lead us to think about the standard monetary system of the time.\nIn the 1890s, midwestern and southern American farmers and small business owners insisted that the silver standard be used together with the traditional gold standard.\nThey believed that the silver standard could put more money in the market and help it circulate, which could help them pay off their debts more easily.\nIn the story, Dorothy acquires a pair of silver slippers after she accidentally kills the Wicked Witch of the East.\nSome people interpret the silver slippers as a symbol of the silver standard, implying that Baum might have been suggesting that the silver and gold standards together could make a better future with more money.",
        "3": "Also, the silver slippers have magical power that can take Dorothy back home, of which she is unaware.\nOnly after meeting Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, in the last scene of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, does Dorothy realize the power of the slippers and find her way back home.\nSome suggest that the slippers represent Dorothy's own potential power.\nShe has them, but she just doesn't know how to use them.\nOnly after all of her adventures can she tap into the power of the slippers and use them to get what she wants.",
        "4": "Dorothy takes the Yellow Brick Road to reach the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz.\nHere is another symbol.\nA road is usually understood as the journey of life that everyone has to take.\nThe journey may be filled with thrills and dangers, but we can also learn many precious lessons from the journey of our life.\nThe Yellow Brick Road may also represent Dorothy's journey.\nOn the way to the Emerald City, she finds that the adventures outside her sheltered life are exciting but dangerous.\nShe also learns about the real meaning of growing up and the comforts of home.\nA road usually promises something wonderful at its end, and Dorothy's journey implies that we need to summon our own courage while we take our own journey and realize the important meaning in our life.",
        "5": "When Dorothy and her friends reach the Emerald City, the Wizard of Oz sends them to kill the Wicked Witch of the West in exchange for their wishes to be granted.\nThe Wicked Witch of the West immediately attacks them with her beasts, birds, black bees, and slaves, and she tries to steal the magical silver slippers off Dorothy's feet.\nDorothy pours a bucket of water onto the witch, soaking her from head to foot.\nTo Dorothy's surprise, the water causes her to simply melt away like brown sugar.\nHere we see that during Dorothy's journey she finds out that wicked witches are just ordinary people.\nWe've all had wicked witches in our lives: for example, difficult problems, scary people, or other types of adversity.\nThey seem to take great joy by making our lives miserable.\nAlthough they may be extremely threatening, the scary things in our life are only as scary as we let them be.\nWe don't have to be scared; we just need to be brave.",
        "6": "Over time, there have been many interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\nHowever, L. Frank Baum never revealed his true intentions with respect to his work to anyone, meaning that there will always be varying interpretations.\nSo you can interpret the story any way you want as long as you can support your ideas.\nIt could be just a story for children, a political commentary, or a call for self-help and self-reliance.\nThe next time you read this story, look for hidden symbols others have never found before.",
        "7": "《The Little Prince》\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab.\nThe soil of that planet was infested with them.\nA baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.\nIt spreads over the entire planet.\nIt bores clear through it with its roots.\nAnd if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it into pieces....\n\"It is a question of discipline,\" the little prince said to me later on.\n\"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care.\nYou must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rose-bushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth.\nIt is very tedious work,\" the little prince added, \"but very easy.\"",
        "8": "And one day he said to me:\n\"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is.\nThat would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.\nSometimes there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.\nBut when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.\nI knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man.\nHe neglected three little bushes....\"\nSo, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet.\nI do not much like to take the tone of a moralist.\nBut the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve.\n\"Children,\" I say plainly, \"watch out for the baobabs!\"",
        "9": "My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.\nThe lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\nPerhaps you will ask me, \"Why are there no other drawings in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?\"\nThe reply is simple.\nI have tried.\nBut with the others I have not been successful.\nWhen I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity."

There is no denying the convenience of e-payments in a cashless world.\nHowever, we should also think about others who might not benefit from this type of system.\nThe other day, I read a newspaper article.\nOne expert warned that changing to an e-payment system can bring about \"exclusion.\"\nHe claimed that a cash-free society pressures all people to belong to a bank and be part of a financial system.\nBut in such a society, the tech-unfriendly can be excluded from the financial system.\nFor example, elderly people who are not used to e-payment systems may not be able to use these systems.\nLast week, I tried to teach my 80-year-old grandmother how to buy something with her smartphone, but she had trouble following my instructions.\nMy grandmother said that learning how to use an e-payment system is not as easy as using cash.\nTaein: Thanks. Sumi is worried that some groups of people may not be able to participate in a cashless economy. Any other opinions?",
        "4": "Dohun: I understand Sumi's concerns and worries about a cashless economy.\nBy replacing coins and bills, however, e-payment systems can reduce or even eliminate the huge cost of producing money every year.\nThe Bank of Korea reported that, in 2016, it spent a total of approximately 150 billion won making coins and bills.\nIf we eliminate this cost by adopting e-payment systems, we can allocate the money we save toward other programs, like improving social welfare for people.\nTaein: Dohun stated that using e-payment systems will save the government a lot of money.\nSo far, Jina and Dohun have pointed out the advantages of a cashless society while Sumi has shown some problems with it.\nAre there any other concerns regarding a cashless world?",
        "5": "Minsu: I'm concerned about the security of a cashless economy.\nIf an e-payment system gets hacked in a cashless world, not only our personal data but also our money can be stolen.\nFor example, in 2016, a bank in the UK froze its online operations because 40,000 accounts had been hacked.\nBut the freeze occurred only after 20,000 customers had lost money from their accounts.\nBack in 2013, a criminal group penetrated more than 100 banks' internal computers.\nThey transferred millions of dollars from banks in Russia, Japan, Switzerland, the United States, and the Netherlands into dummy accounts set up in other countries.",
        "6": "Taein: That's a good point. Thanks, Minsu.\nNow, we must conclude today's discussion about the pros and cons of a cashless society.\nSome of you mentioned that a cashless economy will provide convenience and cost-savings, but others raised concerns about difficulties for tech-unfriendly people and the lack of security.\nIn addition to these, there may be other advantages and disadvantages to a cashless society.\nWhat is your opinion?\nI hope that today's discussion has made you more aware of the positive and negative aspects of living in a cashless society."

        "5": "At his side he heard the assistant gasp in surprise.\nThe emissary had called the man and was showing him the scroll.\n\"Go.

'Glow of jade and clarity of water' — that is what is said about the finest celadon glaze. It is said of very few pieces.\"\nHe paused for a moment and held the shard up before him.\n\"It is true of this one. And the inlay work is remarkable.\"\nHis voice faded for a moment as he gazed in obvious admiration at the shard.\nThen he handed the scroll to the assistant.\n\"Now, go and do as I ask you.\"",
        "6": "The assistant bowed quickly and left.\nEmissary Gim looked at Tree-ear.\nThere was kindness in his eyes — like Crane-man's.\n\"I have written orders for him to secure your trip back to Julpo by sea,\" he said.\n\"You will go and deliver a message to your master for me. I am assigning him a commission.\nTell me, have you worked for Potter Min long?\"\nTree-ear was stunned by the man's words, spoken in such a calm, ordinary voice.\nThrough his disbelief and confusion, he heard himself answer, \"A year and a half, honorable sir.\"\n\"Good. Then perhaps you can tell me — for your master to do his best work, how many pieces per year might I expect from him?\"\nConcentrating on the answer to the emissary's question helped steady Tree-ear.\n\"I think ten. Not fewer, but I don't think he can make many more.\"\nHe looked up and spoke with quiet pride, \"My master works slowly.\"\nThe emissary nodded slowly, \"He must. We need his best work.\"\nHe bowed his head to Tree-ear, \"If you have need of shelter here in Songdo, my assistant will see to it that you are housed and fed until the boat sails.\nYour coming is greatly appreciated.\"\nTree-ear wanted to laugh, to cry, to throw his arms around the emissary and dance wildly around the room.\nInstead, he bowed all the way to the ground.\nHe could not speak but prayed that the emissary understood his silent thanks.\nThere were some things that could not be put into words."

        "2": "《Survey Drones: Eyes in the Sky》\nDrones, small unmanned aerial vehicles, do many jobs on a farm.\nOne of these is to survey fields.\nSurvey drones have GPS-controlled autopilots that let them take off, fly their routes, and land by themselves.\nThey are also equipped with many cameras that take pictures of the fields from the air.\nAs the drones fly, they take pictures from different angles and with different lenses.\nThe images are then analyzed to check for weed growth, ground moisture, and soil conditions.\nEspecially, when drones take pictures with infrared lenses, which sense heat, they can see if plants are healthy or not — because healthy and unhealthy plants give off different amounts of heat.\nThis information helps farmers take care of their crops better, thus increasing the quality and quantity of production.",
        "3": "《Agribots: Robot Farmers》\nAn army of agribots, small autonomous robots designed for agricultural purposes, replaces human workers for a wide range of tasks.\nIn general, agribots tend crops, and each of them is highly specialized for weeding, fertilizing, harvesting, or other farm work.\nAgribots have many benefits.\nFor example, weeding robots can reduce the amount of pollution caused by herbicide use.\nFertilizing robots can greatly reduce fertilizer costs by precisely applying the correct amount of fertilizer in the correct location.\nUsing 3D imaging cameras, harvesting robots can pick fruits and vegetables without damaging them.\nMost importantly, agribots can operate 24/7, 365 days a year, solving the shortage of farm labor while increasing the speed and accuracy of the work.",
        "4": "《Smart Tractors: Self-driving Tractors》\nAlthough agribots are widely used in all the important functions of farming, tractors are still needed for many large-scale and heavy-load tasks.\nNowadays, they are evolving into self-driving vehicles.\nSmart tractors are equipped with GPS controls.\nThey also have optimized route planning software which recommends the shortest route across the field.\nThis can minimize soil erosion by ensuring that all farm tractors follow the same tracks.\nIn addition, the self-driving tractors are accurate down to the millimeter.\nThis means that they can plant seeds in the correct place and harvest crops with no unnecessary movements.\nBesides, they can reduce crop damage and other losses caused by human drivers going off track and into the crops.\nThese smart, self-driving vehicles can also operate during low visibility conditions such as rain, dust, fog, and darkness.",
        "5": "《Texting Cows: Monitoring Livestock with Sensors》\nSensors attached to cows check their temperature, movement, behavior, and so on.\nWhen changes are observed, the sensors send a message to the farmer's phone or computer.\nFor example, these sensors are being used to detect if an animal's back legs begin to lower, which is one of the first signs of illness.\nThey can also sense if a cow is pregnant.\nThis technology saves farmers dozens of hours a week that would otherwise be spent closely monitoring each cow.\nIt also saves money for vets' bills by allowing farmers to deal with cows' illnesses before they get too serious.\nIt goes without saying that using sensors to monitor the health of individual cows lets them live longer, healthier lives, and also improves milk production."

        "3": "Some have asked, \"Why apologise?\"\nLet me begin to answer by telling the parliament just a little of one person's story.\nNanna Nungala Fejo was born in the late 1920s.\nShe remembers her earliest childhood days living with her family and her community in a bush camp.\nShe remembers the love, warmth, and happiness of those days long ago, including traditional dancing around the campfire at night.\nIn 1932, when she was four, she remembers the coming of the welfare men.\nHer family had feared that day and had dug holes in the river bank where the children could run and hide.\nWhat her family had not expected was that the white welfare men did not come alone.\nThey brought a truck, two white men, and an Aboriginal stockman on horseback with a whip.\nThe kids were found; they ran, screaming for their mothers, but they could not get away.\nThey were piled onto the back of the truck.\nTears flowing, her mum tried clinging to the sides of the truck as her children were taken away in the name of protection.",

        "5": "These stories cry out to be heard; they cry out for an apology.\nInstead, from the nation's parliament there has been a stubborn and complete silence for much too long.\nThere has been a view that we, the parliament, should suspend our most basic instincts of what is right and what is wrong; a view that, instead, Parliament should look for any excuse to push this great wrong to one side and to leave it with the historians and the academics, as if the Stolen Generations are little more than an interesting sociological phenomenon.\nBut the Stolen Generations are not intellectual curiosities.\nThey are human beings; human beings who have been damaged deeply by the decisions of parliaments and governments.\nBut, as of today, the time for denial and delay has come to an end.",

        "2": "《Origins》\nThe origin of modern American food trucks can be traced to the Texas chuck wagon born during the post-Civil War cattle boom.\nIn 1886, Charles Goodnight, a cattle man, remodeled an old U.S. Army truck with kitchen supplies and easy-to-store food like coffee, sacks of cornmeal, bacon, and salted beef.\nThe need to feed and care for crews of cowhands resulted in the invention of the wagon.\nAround the same time, on the east coast, a street vendor named Walter Scott cut windows into a small covered wagon and parked it in front of a local newspaper office in Providence, Rhode Island.\nWalter sitting on a box inside, journalists and pressmen came and bought sandwiches, pies and coffee from the wagon.",
        "3": "A more immediate line can be drawn a more taco trucks to the gourmet options we see now.\n\"As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, when I thought of food trucks, I thought of taco trucks,\" said Phil Shen, coauthor of Food Truck Road Trip: A Cookbook.\nSome people credit Raul Martinez of King Taco as the first to pioneer the concept.\nMartinez converted an old ice cream truck into a kitchen and began selling tacos out of it in East Los Angeles in 1974.\nThough there were mobile kitchens selling Mexican food around, Martinez's converted ice cream truck is how the \"taco truck\" was born.\n《Transition into Street Gourmet》\nWhen Mark Manguera and his friend, chef Roy Choi, opened a Korean BBQ taco truck, Kogi, in 2008 and hit the streets in L.A., it forever changed the food climate.\nThey came up with the idea of combining Korean-style meat with Mexican tacos.\nPortable and affordable, the taco was fun, accessible and perfectly suited to the customers who were in search of a quick and tasty bite.\nKogi also proved the food truck was now a place where people could get unique, restaurant quality food.",
        "4": "People went crazy for it and did not hesitate to form a block-long line even before the truck showed up.\nHow did people know the truck would be parked there?\nKogi pioneered the food truck's symbiotic relationship with social media, being one of the first food trucks to utilize SNS to promote their location.\nSince then, food trucks have become a respectable way for aspiring chefs to launch their careers.\nThe biggest advantage food trucks have over traditional brick and mortar restaurants is very low costs.\nNew chefs who want to share their food with the world use food trucks to gain exposure as a stepping stone to more conventional restaurant work.\nThanks to the trend, food lovers get to eat more and more diverse dishes for a great price.\nSoon it will shock nobody if a person says he got his sophisticated lobster roll or organic quinoa burrito from \"a guy in a van.\"",
        "5": "《The Future of Food Trucks》\nFood trucks have grown apart from their mere guerilla roots, which comes with several pros and cons.\nOn one hand, greater acceptance and popularity have led to designated food truck spaces and food truck associations to support the rights of food truck owners.\nOn the other hand, official inspections have also increased, which results in more regulation about where, when, and how food trucks can operate.\nThough he has been concerned, Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president at an American food company, says food truck owners still have a reason to be optimistic for their future.\nHe said, \"The food truck market will continue to grow because food trucks are still a very small fraction of food industry.\"",

        "8": "《British Tea Time》\nOn average, British people each drink about two bathtubs worth, or 876 cups, of tea every year.\nBritain, also known as \"the country of tea,\" has built diverse tea customs through history.\nThese rituals can be observed at several tea times each day.\n\"Breakfast tea\" is the drink trumpeting the beginning of the day, and it sometimes replaces people's breakfast.\nMost British companies offer tea breaks both in the morning and afternoon to help employees relax, enhance their health and ultimately increase the company's productivity.\nPerhaps, however, the most famous British tea custom might be \"afternoon tea.\"\nIn the early 1800s, Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, conceived the idea of having tea around four or five in the afternoon to ward off the hunger pangs between lunch and dinner.\nDuring the 1880s upper-class women would change into long dresses, gloves and hats for their afternoon tea catered for in the drawing room.\nScones, cakes, sandwiches and other finger foods were provided with tea.\nEven though this custom has not been widely followed since World War II, afternoon tea is still the representative tea time of Britain.\nSometimes, you might hear the term, \"high tea,\" which was originally the counterpart of \"afternoon tea\" for working and farming communities but now indicates tea time held between 5-6 p.m.\nConsidering they even have time for tea after dinner, it is no exaggeration to say that British people see tea as a vital part of life."

My name is James and I have been in Korea for almost 4 years.\nI have taught English to all ages and levels and am currently teaching at a high school in Suwon.\nI enjoy living in Korea. I would have left a long time ago if I didn't.",
        "2": "Sujin: Why do people call New Zealanders kiwis?\nJames: The kiwi is an endangered bird unique to New Zealand.\nIn traditional Mãori society, cloaks made of kiwi feathers were only worn by chiefs with great mana, which means prestige.\nIt is also the national bird and a major symbol of our country.\nThe kiwi fruit was bred in New Zealand and named after the bird.\nIf you met me and called me a kiwi, I wouldn't bat an eyelid.\nWe are proud of our national identity.\nSujin: What do New Zealanders like? What do they do during their free time?\nJames: Kiwis like much the same things as people in Korea do, movies, TV, shopping, eating out, drinking, and so on.\nHowever, I think New Zealanders enjoy the outdoors slightly more than Koreans do.\nSports, especially team sports, are far more prominent and nearly everybody knows how to swim.\nPeople of all ages play in social sports leagues on weekends and after school or work.\nA lot of social interactions go together with watching or playing sports and outdoor activities.",
        "3": "Sujin: How can I start a conversation when I meet kiwis?\nJames: Kiwis are mainly friendly people who are happy to have a conversation if you say hello.\nWe also have very relaxed social rules, so being too formal is not a good idea.\nEven if the person is much older than you, you can use their first name.\nHowever, like in other countries, people don't talk to strangers as often in big cities as in smaller towns or the country.\nSujin: Is there anything I need to be careful about when having conversations?\nJames: Kiwis like their personal space, so don't stand too close or touch the other person during conversations.\nSubjects you should avoid include religion and subjects to do with personal wealth.\nPeople think religion is something that is very personal and private.\nAlso, never show off or mention your expensive possessions because modesty is a very important virtue to kiwis.",
        "4": "Sujin: I see. What is the biggest difference in the way people talk to each other you noticed when you came to Korea?\nJames: One thing I definitely noticed is the difference in personal space, especially body contact when speaking.\nIn fact, when I first went to Namdaemun Market, a bag seller grabbed my arm as I walked past trying to attract my attention to his store.\nHad it not been for his friendly expression, I would have pushed him away as hard as I could.\nIn New Zealand, the invasion of someone's personal space by a stranger is a very aggressive act.\nSujin: I have seen photos and read a little about the Mãori people in my textbooks.\nDo they really walk round the street in skirts with tattoos all over their faces?\nJames: No, of course not. Koreans don't walk around in their traditional clothes all the time, and neither do Mãori.\nMãori wear ordinary clothes like all kiwis.\nThe tattoos are called moko and facial moko are fairly uncommon these days.\nMãori also have some cultural rules that you should be aware of.\nFirst, never sit on tables. As tables are for food, sitting on one is seen as very disrespectful.\nSecond, people's heads are regarded as taboo, and should not be touched; this extends to children as well.",
        "5": "Sujin: Interesting! Is there anything else I need to know when I visit New Zealand?\nJames: In cities, be careful to look over your shoulder and hold the door if there are people behind you.\nKiwis are rather reserved and don't approve of emotional outbursts.\nBecause of this, when talking in public you should speak rather quietly to avoid everybody staring at you.\nYou don't need to tip in restaurants.\nThere may be a tip jar next to the cash register in coffee shops and restaurants but they are completely optional.\nEnvironmentalism is a strong theme of New Zealand culture and New Zealanders pride themselves on being \"tidy Kiwis.\"\nThis means that you should neither litter in the streets nor use more water than you need.\nBut don't obsess over these points, just keep a relaxed attitude and you'll be fine.\nSujin: Okay, I'll be sure to follow your advice when I go to New Zealand someday.\nThank you very much for your time and your valuable perspective of New Zealand.\nJames: It was my pleasure.

Elbows perched on the table while eating ― It is generally considered rude in formal settings, though common in more casual situations.\n2. Eating with an open mouth or talking with a full mouth and unapologetic public belching―They are all considered extremely disgusting and are usually expected to be followed by an apologetic verbal, \"Excuse me.\"\n3. Sneezing is weirdly ritualized. People say, \"Excuse me,\" following a sneeze, while anyone in the immediate vicinity says, \"Bless you,\" as a sign of sympathy.\n4. Not making eye contact with the person one is speaking to is considered a rude form of shyness or bored distraction.\n5. There is a debate in Canadian society regarding \"public displays of affection\" or \"PDAs,\" such as cuddling or passionately kissing in public places.\nSome may be inclined to ignore them, while others consider them quite indecent and offensive."

        "3": "《What Do People Do on Boxing Day?》\nBoxing Day has been an important day for sporting events.\nTraditionally, fox hunting was a popular sport with the upper class.\nIt was a traditional part of Boxing Day until 2004, when the ban on fox hunting put an end to the hunt in its traditional form.\nHunters still gather dressed resplendently in red hunting coats to the sound of the hunting horn.\nBut, since it is now forbidden to chase foxes with dogs, a compromise has been reached and the dogs now follow artificially laid trails.\nIn recent times, the day has become synonymous with many sports.\nHorse racing is particularly popular with race days held all over Britain.\nIt is also traditional for the football and rugby leagues in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, to hold a full program of matches on Boxing Day.\nOriginally, matches on Boxing Day were played against local rivals to avoid teams and their fans having to travel long distances after Christmas Day.\nBoxing Day is also a time when the British show their eccentricity by taking part in all kinds of silly activities.\nThese include unusual traditions such as swimming in the icy cold water, fun runs and charity events.",
        "4": "《What Is the New Boxing Day Sport?》\nAnother \"sport\" to emerge in recent years is shopping.\nSadly, what was once a day of relaxation and family time has become the start of a crazy shopping season.\nIn the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday, much like Black Friday which is the day after Thanksgiving in the United States.\nShop owners open their stores early in the morning and offer dramatic discounts to clear unsold Christmas stock.\nPeople stand in lines all night to be the first one to get the best deals.\nBecause of the crowds, many people choose to stay at home and avoid the riots.",
        "5": "《Reclaim the Spirit!》\nThe philanthropic Christmas tradition of giving gifts and money to helpers and household staff to supplement wages still continues, and businesses also grant bonuses and other privileges to their employees.\nSchools collect money and gifts and send them to other neighboring poor countries.\nIn any case, the best way to celebrate the day is of course by sharing your happiness with the most deserved.\nThis very special day gives us an opportunity to give back to society what has lovingly been showered upon us.\nThe true sentiment of the day must never be lost and should inspire us to be more charitable in our lives.",
        "7": "《St. Patrick's Day》\nSt. Patrick's Day is a global celebration of Irish culture on or around March 17th.\nIt celebrates St. Patrick, one of Ireland's patron saints, who helped to introduce Christianity to Ireland by preaching during the fifth century.\nThe most common St. Patrick's Day symbol is the shamrock.\nMany people choose to wear the color green and the flag of the Republic of Ireland is often seen in St. Patrick's Day parades around the world.",
        "8": "《Christmas in Australia》\nThe association of Christmas and snow is ubiquitous.\nNot so in Australia, where it would hardly be reasonable to ask for snow, considering that Christmas in Australia falls in summer.\nThis is the result of the country's location.\nAustralia lies in the southern hemisphere and has opposite seasons to the northern hemisphere.\nIn spite of this, Australians still decorate their living rooms with traditional Christmas trees.\nThey also decorate their houses with bunches of \"Christmas Bush,\" a native Australian tree with small green leaves.\nSmall wooden kangaroo and even koala ornaments are all part of the Christmas tree decorations.\nPeople love to spend their time outdoors swimming, camping, playing cricket, splashing in the waves at the beach or enjoying barbecues in their backyards.\nTurkey and ham, seafood and salads are typical foods enjoyed on Christmas Day.\nOne of the premier Christmas events in Australia is Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve, where people gather in parks and sing all their favorite Christmas carols together by candlelight."

It was a blast!\nAs I already told you, Maddie has been my best friend at school since I moved to Canada nine months ago.\nEven though I've visited her house a handful of times, I haven't had a chance to stay overnight and foster our relationship.\nFilled with anticipation, I walked to Maddie's house.\nBeth and Stephanie, two of my classmates, were also invited and waiting for me.\nAs soon as we got together, we decided to raid the kitchen and make some sandwiches instead of ordering pizza and wings.\nFinishing the sandwiches, we started a weird food experiment.\nStephanie mixed barbecue sauce into semi-melted ice cream.\nAll of us tried it and everyone liked it.\nI put some hot sauce on the mashed potatoes saying, \"This is Korean style mashed potatoes!\"\nAll of them were reluctant to taste it and, for a while, they teased me calling me \"Miss Hot Sauce.\"",

        "4": "Upon arriving at the camp site, next to a small creek Maddie's parents started setting up the tent.\nSo, Maddie and I went to the beach and collected shellfish.\nI could've filled a basket with the shellfish but Don, Maddie's dad, advised us not to.\nDon explained that people need a legitimate National Park fishing permit in order to fish or collect shellfish in all Canadian National Parks.\nHowever, those who are under 16 do not need to obtain the permit as long as they are accompanied by an adult who has one.\nHe also told us that people caught taking undersized seafood have their seafood seized and are fined $100,000 by the judicial system.\nI was so surprised by the size of the fine that I tipped out my basket in the weeds right away.\nWithout Don's permit, I would have had to pay a $100,000 fine or ended up in the police station.\nSoon after dusk, the camp site became very dark.\nAfter a barbecue dinner, Maddie and I gazed at the clear sky.\nThe absence of all artificial city lights made the stars in the sky more brilliant and easy to locate.\nThe dense, quiet forest, and rotting logs made it feel as if time had stood still here for centuries.\nBreaking the silence, Don reminded us not to leave leftover food in the tent because it could attract bears.\nImagining a bear lick my face, I got frightened and my romantic night was over.\nI promptly fled to my tent.",

        "5": "《Community Embraces Togetherness in Difference》\nThere was plenty of feedback from many different people who participated in the fair.\nThe principal of Sage Hill School, Gordon McNeill recalled, \"I thought the multicultural fair was a wonderful event.\nI walked out to the square and I was overwhelmed with everything that was going on.\nBut what impressed me most was seeing our kids, especially the ones that were dressed in their native garb.\nThey were so beautiful.\"\nOne parent, Andria Strelow added, \"I'm so proud of our children.\nThey seemed to already know how to live together.\nIt felt so dignified, grown up and mature.\nAnd they showed Sage at its best.\nThis is what we're about.\"\nThis year, Sage's multicultural fair unified people from different cultures through authentic food, song, dance and art that all provided a glimpse into the diverse cultures of the world.\nIt was an amazing sight to see Sage's student body and the local community come together as a beautiful rainbow of cultures, heritages, and nationalities.\nThis event encouraged all students to experience love and acceptance outside of their own groups, not for where they come from, but for who they are.\nJust like Maya Angelou once wrote in her poetry, \"We are more alike than we are unalike.\"",
        "6": "《Melting Pot or Salad Bowl?》\nIn multicultural societies there are different models of cultural integration.\nThe USA is generally called a melting pot because with time, generations of immigrants have melted together:\nthey have abandoned their cultures to become totally assimilated into American society.\nBut in the U.K., where cultural diversity is considered a positive thing, immigrants have always been encouraged to maintain their traditions and their native language.\nThis model of cultural integration can be described as a salad bowl, with people of different cultures living in harmony, like the vegetables in a salad.\nIn Canada this concept is more commonly known as the cultural mosaic.\nBoth models of multicultural societies have contradictory aspects:\nin a melting pot there is no cultural diversity and sometimes differences are not respected; in a salad bowl cultures do not mix at all.\nSo which model is better?\nThe ideal situation would be a society where all citizens have equal rights and opportunities, but can also maintain their own individuality.\nIt is not easy to put this ideal into practice, but multicultural societies are now a reality and we must learn to live together in the best possible way.",
        "7": "《Why People With Multicultural Experience Are More Creative》\nOne way to enhance creativity is to immerse yourself in a multicultural experience.\nWhen you dive into a different culture, two interesting things happen.\nFirst, it increases your overall openness to new experiences.\nThat lack of prejudice often leads to more creative ideas.\nSecond, you come to recognize that everything in the world can be viewed in many different ways ― a key aspect of learning to adapt to a new culture.\nTherefore, people who have spent time adapting to more than one culture are better able to generate new ideas.\nWhat does this mean for you who do not have the opportunity to spend time in another country?\nIt means that you should at least seek out new social groups that you can interact with.\nSeeing the world through different people's eyes is a great way of enhancing your own openness and creativity."

        "4": "In addition to making open structures, architects add large gardens.\nThis greenery provides shade and protects parts of the building from direct sunlight, which keeps the building cooler.\nEco-friendly buildings like these not only help protect the environment, but also provide people with a good quality of life.\nThose are the goals of this new style of architecture.\nHopefully, architects will keep coming up with new eco-friendly ideas.\nEvery field has different ways of protecting the environment.\nWith more innovation, humans and nature will be able to live together in harmony far into the future."

And I will call you Hyeong-pil from now on.\"\nTree-ear was so surprised that he couldn't believe his ears.\nNow, he had a name that shared a character with Potter Min's dead son Hyeong-gu!\nHyeong-pil started to push the cart up the mountain path.\nAs he watched a crane in the distance, he dreamed of the beautiful vase that he would make.\nOne of the finest examples of Korean inlaid pottery is called the \"Thousand Cranes Vase.\"\nIts maker is unknown."

Dried plants?\nI'm afraid that's not right.\nIt is made of newspaper.\nNewspaper is commonly recycled, but it takes a lot of energy to recycle it.\nSo, instead of just collecting newspapers and sending them to recycling places, you can make your own basket.\nShopping Cart Chairs\nLet's move on to the next one.\nIt's a shopping cart chair.\nMany of you might wonder how a shopping cart can be recycled.\nHere's an interesting way.\nBy taking out some unnecessary parts and adding a seat, a shopping cart can be a wonderful chair which even has a place to rest your arms."

        "1": "《The Magic of Morning Pages》\nWelcome to my channel Good Habits!\nThis is Regan, your podcast host.\nToday, I'm going to talk about a way of starting the day that many people, including me, find enormously useful.\nIt's a kind of journaling called \"the morning pages.\"\nThere is no age at which it is too late to form this habit.\nI started eight years ago as a high school student, and that's why today's episode is especially for my teenage subscribers.\nThe morning pages are three pages of \"free writing,\" ideally done first thing in the morning.\nThe concept is simple.\nGet up every morning, pick up a pen and a notebook, and write whatever crosses your mind until you have filled three pages.\nThe technique was originally developed to help writers and artists overcome a loss of creativity, but anybody can use it to create a better life.",
        "2": "There is no right or wrong way to write your morning pages, but there are two rules.\nFirst, don't judge your writing as good or bad.\nThese pages are meant to be a \"brain cleansing,\" so don't worry about writing correctly.\nSecond, keep your writing completely private.\nIt is important for you to write freely and honestly.\nYou're even advised not to read your writing yourself for weeks.\nNow, let me share the experiences of some people I interviewed.\nDavid, a chef and kitchen manager, who has been writing morning pages for two years, says:\nMy job tends to be very stressful.\nWhen I started writing morning pages, I just wrote a lot of complaints about my hard life.\nLater, I began to ask questions, like \"What would make my life easier today?\" \"How can I improve my recipes?\"\nSometimes, I keep asking questions until I reach a sort of \"click moment.\"\nIt feels like a door opening to great ideas.\nNowadays, I feel less stressed, enjoy my job more, and am more productive.",
        "3": "Now, let's listen to Yuna, a high school junior:\nWhen I started this exercise last year, I simply wrote random thoughts like this:\nI'm sleepy. A slight headache's starting.\nI need to finish the math assignment today ...\nI don't know what more to write now.\nBut soon I found I had deeper and deeper thoughts.\nNow, I normally start by writing about today's tasks or worries.\nAfter that, I write about my dreams and how to move towards them.\nI often come up with great plans and a clear sense of purpose to start the day.\nMost importantly, I'm much happier than before.",
        "4": "I can totally relate to these two people because their experiences are similar to mine.\nLike Yuna, I started this journaling during my first year of high school.\nAt that time, I felt lost, stressed, and unsure about the future, and it wasn't easy for me to concentrate.\nWhen I first tried writing three daily pages, I didn't expect to stick to it.\nBut I did, and it changed my life!\nReleasing my feelings onto paper every morning helped relieve my emotional tension.\nI gained more inner peace, which improved my schoolwork performance.\nLike David, I asked many questions, for instance, \"Why was I so angry yesterday?\" \"Why are things less fun these days?\"\nThen, I started raising more challenging ones:\n\"What could make me happier right now?\"\n\"What is my ideal future? Can I reach it? How?\"",
        "5": "Answering these questions showed me what kind of person I was and what my needs, values, passions, and talents were.\nMore importantly, I came to know what I truly wanted!\nI remembered my childhood dreams of being a writer, songwriter, and radio host.\nGradually, vague ideas became clear plans.\nYears later, here I am, a successful podcaster and vlogger!\nI've also published a book and a music album.\nMy morning pages, which I still write every day, have given me the drive and ideas to achieve these aims.\nDear subscribers, will you try writing your morning pages, too?\nYou never know what creative energy or ideas you have until you start exploring.\nDon't be a perfectionist, though.\nIf you miss a few days, simply open your notebook and start again!\nThe ultimate aim is to improve your mental health and help you lead a happier, more creative life."

        "2": "During the past few decades, however, scientists have begun to find more and more similarities between octopuses and humans.\nOne of the most interesting ones is intelligence.\nOctopuses are smart.\nThe best evidence is their ability to camouflage themselves.\nAn octopus can change its color, pattern, and texture, and the changes are carried out almost instantly.\nIn terms of speed and the diversity of change, no other animal can rival octopuses.\nEven chameleons can utilize only a handful of fixed patterns.\nThe main purpose of these changes is to avoid detection by their hunters or their prey.\nWhen an octopus encounters its hunter or prey, it must decide very quickly which color, pattern, and texture to choose.\nSuch a decision implies that it has gained sufficient knowledge of the surrounding animals and applies it to survive.\nTo acquire knowledge and apply it for a particular purpose is a sure sign of intelligence.",
        "3": "Another sign of the intelligence of the octopus is its use of tools.\nIn the lab, octopuses use tools to get food rewards.\nIn the wild, they use stones to create walls to protect the entrances to their homes.\nThey use not only stones but anything they can find to protect themselves.\nThe most impressive example of octopuses using tools came in 2009 in Indonesia.\nA few octopuses were found to collect coconut shells.\nThey cleaned the shells with bursts of water, carried them to a new location, and piled them as a shelter.\nTraveling with the shells under their bodies forced them to walk slowly along the sea floor.\nThis made the octopuses more exposed to predators.\nBut it seems that they were willing to take that risk for greater future protection.\nThe scientists who discovered the behavior argue that this is clear evidence of octopuses using tools.",
        "4": "Octopuses' use of tools can be found in their love of toys and puzzles, too.\nThey are curious about new objects, and do not like getting bored.\nThat is why aquariums try to come up with ideas to keep their octopuses busy.\nSome aquariums hide food inside a big doll and let the octopus break up the toy to get the food.\nOthers offer plastic building blocks for their octopuses to play with.\nOur knowledge about the octopus is still very limited.\nThanks to the efforts of scientists, however, it is expanding year by year.\nOne of the most impressive new findings about the octopus is that it seems to have feelings.\nOf course, it is impossible for us to know exactly what they feel, but a few of their changes in skin color seem to be linked to their feelings.\nFor example, a giant Pacific octopus that turns red seems to be excited, while it is white when it is relaxed.\nAn octopus presented with a difficult puzzle often undergoes several rapid changes in color.\nThe octopus seems to be worried that it may not solve the problem.",
        "5": "Few scientists today deny that octopuses are intelligent animals.\nPerhaps it is time that we stopped thinking of them as alien creatures and acknowledged them as intelligent animals like us.\nThere is still so much we do not know about the octopus.\nAren't you curious about what is inside their mind?"

Avoid a Double Chin\nMake sure the camera lens is at your eye level or above.\nIf the lens is below your eye level, you may look like you have a double chin in the photo.\nYou can also try to stick your chin out a little bit.\nThis way, your neck will look longer and thinner."

        "2": "My grandparents were thrilled when I told them my idea.\nWith the help of investors, we could build a large greenhouse and grow a lot more strawberries.\nMoreover, we could reward the investors for their help by sending them jars of organic jam!\nWith this plan in mind, the next step was to figure out the details.\n《Campaign Details》\nBefore beginning your campaign, be sure to plan all the production details.\nHow many products will you make?\nHow long will it take to make the product?\nThis planning is important because your potential investors will want to see a clear schedule.\nOnce your plan is complete, remember to set your funding goal.\nIt should be enough to complete the project and fulfill the rewards for the investors.\nConsider all the necessary costs before deciding on the amount.",

        "1": "《Timing is Everything》\nHost: Welcome back to Today's Health.\nToday we're going to be talking about exercise.\nDr. Victoria Hill is here, and she is going to share some useful tips.\nSo, Dr. Hill, let's start with a question about my experience last month.\nI worked out right after dinner and got a stomachache.\nWhy did that happen?\nDr. Hill: Well, the problem is that you exercised too soon after eating.\nThis can cause various stomach issues.\nWhen you eat, blood rushes to the digestive system to help break down the food and absorb its nutrients.\nBut when you start to exercise, blood moves from the digestive system to your muscles.\nThis happens in order to supply your muscles with the oxygen and nutrients they require.\nAs a result, the digestion process is paused until the blood returns.\nSo, whether you're lifting weights or going for a jog, you shouldn't do it with a stomach full of food.",
        "2": "Host: I see. That makes sense.\nSo, does that mean I should exercise on an empty stomach?\nDr. Hill: No, it doesn't. That can also be harmful and unpleasant.\nThis is because the body needs energy to exercise.\nThe fuel that provides this energy is glycogen.\nCarbohydrates in the food we eat are broken down into a kind of sugar called glucose.\nWhen this glucose is stored in parts of the body, such as the muscles and the liver, it is called glycogen.\nThis is why exercising on a completely empty stomach ─ such as when you first wake up in the morning ─ can be such a challenge.\nYour blood sugar levels are low, and you don't have enough glycogen stored in your body.\nIf you exercise on an empty stomach, you will most likely lack energy and feel unusually tired.\nThere can also be more serious outcomes.\nSome people end up suffering from nausea and headaches, and others even faint.\nThis is because intense exercise uses up all the glycogen in your muscles.",
        "3": "Host: So, is it the loss of glycogen that causes us to have low levels of energy?\nDr. Hill: That's correct. For this reason, doctors recommend that people eat food containing carbohydrates within thirty minutes after working out.\nThis replaces the muscle glycogen you have lost.\nBasically, you need between one and one and a half grams of carbohydrates for every kilogram you weigh.\nLet's do the math.\nIf you weigh 60 kilograms, you should try to consume between 60 and 90 grams of carbohydrates after you exercise.\nThis is equal to about one bowl of white rice or three bananas.",
        "4": "Host: That's very interesting. But what about eating before we exercise?\nCan you explain how long we should wait after eating?\nDr. Hill: Well, as I said before, exercising right after you eat will cause feelings of discomfort.\nBut, if you wait too long to exercise after eating, you'll suffer from a lack of energy.\nThe best time to eat before you exercise varies from one to three hours.\nBasically, it depends on several factors such as the type and amount of food as well as body size, age, and gender.\nThe type of exercise also matters.\nFor extremely active exercise like cycling, I suggest that you wait between one and a half and three hours after eating a moderate-sized meal.\nBut for something more casual, such as golfing, waiting for one hour after a meal should be enough.\nClearly, you can wait less after eating a snack.\nHost: Thank you very much for this fascinating information, Dr. Hill.\nI'm sure it will be very helpful for all of our viewers."

        "4": "《The Debate on Using AI》\nMany AI programs are open to the public, which means they are free and convenient to use.\nHowever, these programs have sparked a debate over their impact on humans.\nSince AI has the potential to learn skills and perform them better than humans, some people view it as a threat.\nThey worry that AI will replace humans in more and more areas.\nThere are also concerns that AI may imitate the styles of human artists without their consent.\nOn the other hand, others think that AI cannot exceed human imagination and that it is still dependent on human assistance.\nThis is because the data that AI uses can have flaws or limitations.\nA dependence on imperfect data with little diversity eventually limits the output of AI programs.\nHuman imagination, on the other hand, has no limits or boundaries.\nWhat kind of future do you think lies ahead of us?\nWill more people use AI programs to boost their creativity and productivity?\nOr will people grow tired of the limitations of AI tools?\nAI provides many benefits and new opportunities.\nWhat we need to do is figure out how to use AI tools ethically and think about how humans and AI can collaborate."

The idea came from an experience I had as a psychiatrist.\nOne of my patients had become severely depressed.\nHowever, she couldn't get help because she was unable to afford the bus ride to the hospital.\nThis shocked me, as I had never considered such a problem before.\nIn fact, it is difficult for many people in Zimbabwe to pay for transportation and receive medical treatment.\nFurthermore, there has been a lack of psychiatrists in the country for many years.\nWhen the Friendship Bench program started in 2006, there were only eleven psychiatrists serving Zimbabwe's population of over twelve million people.\nI needed to find a way to bring psychiatry into the community.",
        "2": "Host: Oh, so that was the beginning of it.\nCould you explain to us how the Friendship Bench program works?\nDr. Chibanda: Certainly. The program was created as a way to provide accessible mental health services.\nIt offers talk therapy sessions to people dealing with issues such as depression or anxiety.\nThe sessions are free and are provided by respected elderly women from the community.\nThese women, called \"grandmothers,\" volunteer to sit with patients at the benches, listen to their stories, and provide them with emotional support.\nHost: What a wonderful idea! How did these amazing grandmothers become a part of your program?\nDr. Chibanda: Grandmothers were chosen for our program because they are deeply connected to the community.\nMoreover, they have all the qualities of a counselor, such as excellent listening skills, empathy, and the ability to engage in meaningful discussions.\nThey are also very reliable, which is important for our efforts to support mental health.\nAt the beginning, we started with only fourteen volunteer grandmothers.\nBut today, there are thousands of grandmothers who have been trained to provide Friendship Bench therapy in Zimbabwe.",
        "3": "Host: That's interesting! What happens after patients complete their sessions with the grandmothers?\nDr. Chibanda: When the sessions with the grandmothers are over, patients are encouraged to join a community support group made up of former patients of the program.\nThe members of these groups can easily relate to and support one another.\nThis is because most of them come from the same community and have experienced similar struggles.\nHost: That sounds like a great way to continue the support and build a sense of community.\nAnd the program has been incredibly successful, right?\nDr. Chibanda: That's correct. In 2022, we provided face-to-face counseling to about 90,000 patients in Zimbabwe.\nNow, Friendship Benches are available in more than twenty different regions around the country.\nOur vision is for everyone to have a Friendship Bench within walking distance, and we are working hard to make it happen.\nWe've also started expanding the program, and we now offer online counseling through an app.\nThis has helped us reach even more people.",

Thank you for your time, Dr. Chibanda.\nNow let's hear from one of the grandmothers who volunteers for the program.\nCan you introduce yourself and tell us how you got involved with the Friendship Bench program?\nGrandma Moyo: Hello, my name is Judith Moyo, but people call me Grandma Moyo.\nI'm 76 years old, and I have been volunteering for the Friendship Bench program for about eight years.\nI joined the program because many people in my community struggle with mental health problems, and I wanted to do something about it.\nI knew that I could help heal their wounded hearts by supporting them.",
        "5": "Host: That's very kind of you. Can you tell us about your experience as a grandmother for the Friendship Bench program?\nGrandma Moyo: It's been wonderful. Seeking help for mental health problems is nothing to be ashamed of.\nI've seen how it can make a difference in people's lives.\nOne patient of mine, a nineteen-year-old girl, was going through a difficult time after her mom passed away.\nI counseled her and helped her begin her recovery journey.\nNow her life is back on track, and she has even started her own business!\nCases like this make me so proud to be part of the program.\nIt is such a rewarding experience to help people make positive changes in their lives.\nHost: Thanks for sharing your experiences with us today, Grandma Moyo.\nIt's truly inspiring to see the influence that the Friendship Bench program has had.\nAnd it's all thanks to the hard work of people like you and Dr. Chibanda."

        "2": "The story behind these emails begins with Melbourne's Urban Forest Strategy plan, a response to Australia's millennium drought.\nThis drought lasted from the late 1990s to 2010.\nBy the time it ended, 40 percent of the city's 77,000 trees were in a state of declining health.\nFurthermore, the overall number of trees was decreasing.\nAs a result, the amount of shade provided by trees within the city, also known as canopy cover, decreased.\nThe loss of canopy cover is a major threat to urban environments because it raises temperatures.\nHigher temperatures in cities can be dangerous for residents, as they increase the risk of heat exhaustion*.\nThey also lead to a rise in the use of air-conditioning.\nThis speeds up climate change by increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "3": "Something had to be done to deal with the loss of Melbourne's trees.\nIn 2012, the city government announced its Urban Forest Strategy plan.\nIt set the ambitious goal of planting more than 3,000 trees every year for the next twenty years.\nThe plan also involved the creation of an online map called the Urban Forest Visual.\nThis interactive map shows the location of every single tree in the city's parks and along its roads.\nIt uses colors and symbols to indicate each tree's age and genus.\nAlso, users can click on a tree to find out its species and even send it an email.\nAt first, the \"Email this tree\" function had a specific purpose.\nIt was designed to allow people to easily inform council workers about trees that were damaged or in poor health.",
        "4": "After the map was posted online, something unexpected happened.\nThe trees started receiving thousands of emails, but many of them were not reports about damage or poor health.\nInstead, they were love letters, poems, greetings, and messages expressing appreciation for the trees.\nOne person wrote, \"I love the way the light shines on your leaves and how your branches hang so low.\nIt is almost like you are trying to hug me.\"\nThe tree mail phenomenon quickly spread, and people all over the world started sending messages.\nA message that was sent all the way from Russia said, \"When I read about this wonderful project, I was inspired to write to you, even though I live thousands of miles away.\nAlthough we are separated by a great distance, we share the same planet and the same environment.\nPerhaps one day we will meet.\nUntil then, I hope you can stay healthy and strong.\"\nThe global popularity of the tree mail phenomenon reminds us that we are all connected to nature, and we are all involved in building a more sustainable world.\nWithout collective action from people across the globe, we would have little hope of saving our planet for future generations.",
        "5": "Locally, the tree mail phenomenon has inspired many Melbourne residents to offer their own ideas about building an environmentally friendly urban environment.\nSome have even volunteered to measure trees and monitor animals for nature programs in the city.\nMeanwhile, the Urban Forest Strategy's tree planting project has remained on track, and canopy cover is predicted to increase from 23 percent in 2012 to 40 percent by the year 2040.\nMelbourne's urban forest strategy will help keep the city cool.\nIt will also allow residents to interact with nature and engage in outdoor activities every day.\nAs a result, residents will be happier and healthier as they move toward a greener future."

        "1": "《Wishful Recycling》\nMost people agree with the idea that recycling is an easy way to make a positive impact on the planet.\nIt makes you feel good about yourself, too.\nBut your efforts may sometimes be harming the environment instead.\nHow can this be?\nWell, it is because you might be a wishcycler.",
        "2": "《What Is Wishcycling?》\nImagine the following situation.\nOn your way home from school, someone hands you a piece of paper.\nYou glance at the shiny flyer advertising a new study cafe.\nAs you are about to throw it into the garbage, you decide to put it into the recycling bin instead.\nYou think flyers can be recycled because they're made of paper.\nWhat just happened is a case of wishcycling.\nIt is the act of trying to recycle something that should not be recycled.\nWishcycling is usually done with good intentions, but it often causes more harm than good.",
        "3": "《Why Is It a Problem?》\nThe biggest problem with wishcycling is that it creates more waste.\nFor example, if you wishcycle a greasy pizza box, it can soak clean paper products with oil.\nThen everything in the recycling bin will become non-recyclable and end up in a landfill.\nCreating more waste is not the only problem, however.\nWishcycling also leads to costly delays.\nTo process recyclable items, non-recyclable items must be sorted out first.\nThe more non-recyclable items are mixed with recyclable items, the longer it will take to pick them out.\nWishcycled items can also damage the sorting machines, causing them to be temporarily shut down for repairs.",
        "4": "《How Can We Stop Wishcycling?》\nWith a little effort, we can put an end to wishcycling.\nFirst, make sure your recyclables are empty, clean, and dry.\nShake out any remaining liquid from bottles and jars.\nAfter that, wash them out and wait for them to dry.\nYou also need to remove the labels.\nNow they are ready to be tossed in the recycling bin.\nThis simple process will ensure that all the items in the recycling bin can be recycled.\nSecond, learn about the meanings of various recycling symbols.\nThey tell you about the material of the item and whether it can be recycled or not.\nHave you ever seen a recycling symbol with the number \"7\" and the word \"other\" under it?\nThis symbol means the product is made of two different materials and will be difficult to recycle.\nChecking the recycling symbols like this will help you stop wishcycling.",
        "5": "Third, check the recycling guidelines for your local area.\nDifferent areas have different rules on what can be recycled.\nYou can easily learn about the guidelines for your area by visiting your local government website.\nYou can also look for recycling posters near recycling bins.\nLastly, don't recycle an item when in doubt.\nEven after you check the symbols and guidelines, you might still be unsure whether it is recyclable.\nIn that case, you should put it in the trash.\nYou might feel bad that you may be throwing away a recyclable item.\nHowever, doing so may actually be better for the environment.\nTake comfort in the fact that you are not wishcycling.\nWe all know that living without producing trash is impossible.\nThe good news is that about 75 percent of our waste can be recycled when it is done properly.\nThis is why we need to stop wishcycling and start recycling.\nSo hop on the #stopwishcycling movement and help keep our planet green!"

        "1": "《Why You Buy What You Buy》\nGood afternoon, students.\nToday, I'd like to talk about a topic that concerns us all: Money!\nDo you think that you spend money wisely?\nThe truth is that most people are not as rational as they think.\nThis is because human beings are easily influenced by psychological factors.\nLet me illustrate my point through the following examples.",
        "2": "《The Anchoring Effect》\nIn 2010, Steve Jobs introduced the tablet computer to the world.\nDuring the presentation, he said, \"We're going to price it under a thousand dollars,\" which most people assumed meant $999.\nHe went on to talk about the features of the tablet and continued to justify why the tablet was worth buying.\nAt the end, he said, \"I am thrilled to announce to you that the pricing starts not at $999 but at just $499.\"\nThe crowd went wild.\nThe tablet suddenly seemed affordable to everyone.\nHe put the $999 price tag in people's minds at the beginning so that the $499 price would seem a lot cheaper in comparison.\nSteve Jobs used something called the anchoring effect to his advantage here.\nIt works because people tend to rely on the first piece of information they receive when making decisions.",
        "3": "Let's say you are shopping for a new jacket and the first one you see is priced at $100.\nThat's too expensive, as you don't want to spend more than $50.\nSoon after, you see a similar jacket from a different brand with a $70 price tag.\nYou think it's affordable, even though the price is still beyond your budget.\nThis is because the first piece of information acts as an anchor that influences your decisions later.\nHere's another common example.\nLook at the two pairs of sneakers.\nThey both are $50, but the way their price is presented is different.\nNaturally, people are more drawn to the second pair.\nThis is because the original price serves as an anchor, making the discounted price appear more reasonable in comparison.\nIt is common for stores to use this kind of price anchoring as a way to encourage purchases.",
        "4": "《The Endowment Effect》\nNow let's move on to another interesting effect.\nIn an experiment, one group of students was given a coffee mug and a second group a chocolate bar.\nBoth groups were told they could exchange their items.\nA third group wasn't given anything and was told to choose either a chocolate bar or a coffee mug.\nThis group showed an equal preference for the two items.\nAbout half of the group chose the chocolate bar, and the other half chose the coffee mug.\nThis suggested that roughly half of the first and second groups would trade their items.\nBut that's not what happened.\nOnly about 10 percent of the students in the first and second groups were willing to make the exchange.\nWhy is this?\nThis is because people value something more when they own it.\nThis is the basic idea of the endowment effect.\nPeople are less likely to give up what they already have or trade it for something else.",
        "5": "Companies often use the endowment effect as a marketing strategy.\nFor example, many media streaming companies offer free trials to customers.\nOnce customers use the free trial, they feel ownership of that service, even if it's temporary.\nConsequently, they are likely to value it more and are willing to pay to continue to own it.\nA free-return policy is another example.\nSay that a company is offering free returns on a smartwatch within 30 days of purchase.\nIt seems like a good deal, since you can get a refund even after using the item.\nBut once you take this deal and establish ownership of the watch, it is unlikely that you will return it.\nAs we've seen, our spending can be influenced by factors that appeal to our emotions and mind.\nI hope this short lecture gave you a chance to reflect on your own spending and helped you understand the reasons behind irrational purchasing decisions."

        "2": "This sudden discovery, insight, or inspiration is called a eureka moment.\nThe Greek word eureka translates to \"I have found it.\"\nThis expression comes from a famous story from ancient Greece.\nA king asked a mathematician named Archimedes to check if his crown was made of pure gold.\nArchimedes tried everything but could not come up with a solution.\nTo cool his head, he stepped into a bath.\nSeeing the water overflow, he realized at that moment that he could measure the purity of the crown by putting it in water.\nHe jumped out of the bath, screaming, \"Eureka! Eureka!\"\nA eureka moment may seem miraculous, but that is far from the truth.\nIt is the result of a long process in which ideas form, mix, and develop.\nWhether you're a mathematician or a student, here are some strategies to maximize your chances of having a eureka moment.",
        "3": "《1. Burn the Midnight Oil》\nIt is important to understand that great ideas do not come without great effort.\nThey are based on countless nights of pondering a given subject.\nFor example, J.K. Rowling did not become a best-selling author overnight.\nShe devoted lots of time to writing and reading books.\nShe wrote her first story when she was six and her first novel at age eleven.\nShe also had a strong passion for reading.\nWhen she was in college, she read so much that she had to pay a fine of 50 pounds for overdue library books.\nBefore you can come up with new and creative ideas, you need to familiarize yourself with a given field.\nOnce you have studied a subject thoroughly, you can find yourself one step closer to your eureka moment.",
        "4": "《2. Think outside the Box》\nHumans are creatures of habit.\nWe find comfort in routines and patterns.\nHowever, this can sometimes limit our creativity and problem-solving abilities.\nIf you are stuck trying to solve a problem, thinking in the same old way is unlikely to lead to a solution.\nTake the nine dots problem, for example.\nThe challenge is to connect all nine dots using only four straight lines without lifting your pencil from the paper.\nMost people's first instinct is to stay within the boundaries of the square shape, but you can only solve this problem if you go outside the square.\nTo start thinking outside the box, surround yourself with people who have different perspectives.\nHaving conversations with them is a great way to actively seek new insight.\nNot only will it be refreshing, but it might also spark a eureka moment by opening you up to new ideas.",
        "5": "《3. Stop and Smell the Roses》\nA brain that is well rested is often the most efficient one.\nAre you familiar with the song Yesterday by the Beatles?\nIt has been called the greatest song of the 20th century, and its melody came to a band member in his sleep!\nAfter performing many concerts, Paul McCartney was very tired and fell asleep.\nIn his dream, he heard a beautiful melody.\nHe woke up and played it on his piano, and the rest is history.\nA eureka moment like this one cannot come from an overworked brain.\nIf you are stressed and your mind is filled with thoughts, the chance of a eureka moment is low.\nIf, however, your mind is relaxed and at peace, there is more room for new ideas to enter.\nGoing for a walk in the park, treating yourself to a warm cup of tea, or maybe even taking a steaming shower might be just what you need for a eureka moment."

        "1": "《The Power of Friendliness: Soft but Strong》\nIt's good to see you, everyone!\nI'm Dr. Edward Wilson, an evolutionary biologist.\nThank you for inviting me here today.\nOn my way, I had trouble locating this room. Luckily, a friendly student came up to me and walked me here.\nIt's fascinating how, in situations like this, we want to help someone in need.\nNow, this raises some interesting questions: where does our friendliness come from, and why is it important?\nTo answer these questions, I'd like to tell you about my childhood companion dog, Sparky.\nWhen we played with a ball, I noticed that he responded well to my gestures.",
        "2": "The responsive behavior of dogs also caught the attention of an evolutionary anthropologist, Brian Hare.\nHe conducted an experiment to see how dogs would respond to human gestures compared to wolves, who share the same common ancestor.\nHe placed two cups on the ground with food hidden under only one of them.\nWhen he pointed to the cup with the food, the dogs found it easily.\nThe wolves, however, struggled and chose cups at random, paying no attention to his gestures.\nDr. Hare concluded that the dogs' ability to read human gestures allowed them to perform better than the wolves.\nHe explained that dogs, unlike wolves, have developed communicative skills with humans and a sense of friendliness.\nThis explanation sounds reasonable according to several evolutionary biologists.\nThey say that from the common ancestors of these two species, those that acted friendly toward humans evolved into dogs, and those that didn't became wolves.\nFurthermore, Dr. Hare suggested that the friendly nature of dogs probably provided them a survival advantage that allowed their population to grow larger than that of wolves.",
        "3": "I'll give you another example of how friendliness is related to survival.\nDr. Hare and his colleagues designed an experiment with chimpanzees and bonobos.\nAlthough the two are genetically similar, they are different in nature.\nTo study their cooperative behavior, Dr. Hare's team set up a device which required two individuals to pull both ends of a rope at the same time in order to access food on a board.\nWhen placed with partners that the chimpanzees knew, they were able to work together to get the food.\nHowever, when paired with new partners, the chimpanzees usually failed to get the food, and when they occasionally succeeded, they did not share the food with their partner.\nThe bonobos, on the other hand, got along much better than the chimpanzees.\nThey solved the problem regardless of which individual they were paired with, and they were also more willing to share the food.\nThis research shows that bonobos have a cooperative and friendly nature.\nExperts suggest that their nature has helped their species survive.\nWithout these characteristics, they could have faced extinction.",
        "4": "Now let's turn our attention to ourselves, Homo sapiens.\nHow have we managed to survive for so long?\nNeanderthals existed together with Homo sapiens until about 40,000 years ago, and they were known to be intelligent and physically superior to Homo sapiens.\nNeanderthals were able to make tools and fire and had strong bodies with well-developed muscles and broad shoulders.\nDespite these attributes, however, it was Homo sapiens who ultimately survived and thrived.\nOne possible explanation is that our ancestors lived in larger communities that promoted cooperation and the free exchange of knowledge, while Neanderthals tended to live in smaller groups.\nThese social differences may have given Homo sapiens a competitive advantage over Neanderthals, allowing them to adapt to an ever-changing environment.",
        "5": "In our competitive society, many people believe that only the biggest or the strongest can survive and thrive.\nHowever, I propose an alternative view: kindness is the key to success.\nIsn't that a comforting thought?\nWe can use the power of our natural kindness to communicate and cooperate with different individuals.\nWe can all benefit from this instead of trying to be better than others.\nI'd like to end this talk with a message.\nThink of our society as a bouquet.\nJust as each flower adds to the beauty when it harmonizes with the others, each person can contribute to a more beautiful world when they cooperate.\nBy being kind and working together, we can truly flourish.\nThank you for your attention."

        "4": "The next day, I met Ms. Harper after school to talk about the speech.\nI said, \"I'm embarrassed about the speech.\nI must have looked like a fool.\nI know I could have done better.\"\n\"It's quite all right to fall short of your own expectations as long as you learn something from it,\" she said in a warm voice.\n\"What was bothering you the most while you prepared for the speech?\"\n\"I was afraid the other students would laugh at me if my speech wasn't good enough.\"\nShe replied, \"You certainly can't control what others think about your speech.\nThat means you should be focusing on the one thing you can control ─ how you give your speech.\"\nThat woke me up from the depths of despair.\nOf course, that was it!\nI wouldn't have been able to make my classmates like what I wanted to say.\nI really should have focused on my performance.",
        "5": "A couple of weeks later, the class was given another speech assignment.\nI didn't want to drop the ball like the first time.\nSo this time, I practiced delivering the speech.\nI stood in front of the mirror every day for a week and went over all the things I wanted to say.\nI used cue cards which contained key phrases about important facts.\nI rehearsed how I would stand, how I would make eye contact with the audience, and even when I would pause.\nI felt nervous again when the big day finally arrived.\nBut when the teacher called my name, I noticed that my nerves had actually calmed down a bit.\nI felt way better than the last time, for sure!\nI walked up to the front of the class and looked out into the audience.\nMy heart began to race, and I took a deep breath to calm it down.\nWhile my voice trembled from time to time, I managed to get my whole message across.\nWhen I was done, I felt so proud of myself that I barely noticed how loudly everyone was clapping for me!"

        "1": "《Understanding Your Behavior》\nHello, first-year students.\nI'm your school counselor, Hannah Kim.\nHow is your new school life?\nYou may have experienced a situation where things didn't go as you expected at school.\nHave you ever wondered why this happens?\nLet's take a look at the following two cases.\nThe first case is about a student named Hajun.\nOn the first day of school, Hajun's homeroom teacher introduced several school clubs.\nAt that time, Hajun didn't have a particular preference for any of them.\nHe thought that any indoor club would be okay since he was not an outdoor person.\nCan you guess what happened on the day of choice?\nHe joined the soccer club.\nWhat made him choose soccer?",

        "2": "When Dr. Hahn got there, he learned that the staple food in Nigeria was a plant called cassava.\nUnfortunately, cassava was defenseless against viral and bacterial diseases, so it did not yield much crop.\nKnowing this, he decided to develop stronger cassava varieties with higher yields.\nHowever, Dr. Hahn faced a problem: there was not much information available about cassava.\nCassava was rarely studied or developed because it was not a cash crop.\nTo make matters worse, he had never seen or eaten cassava before.\nWhile studying African cassava, Dr. Hahn found out that the Europeans who colonized Brazil had first brought cassava into Africa.\nHe immediately flew to Brazil to study the original cassava.\nThere, he learned about it and went back to Nigeria with Brazilian cassava seeds.\nThen, Dr. Hahn traveled to every corner of Nigeria and collected different types of local cassava to see if they were good at fighting diseases, but they weren't.\nFortunately, he found a plant that was similar to cassava but resistant to diseases.\nHe started crossing this plant with the Brazilian cassava.\nAfter five years of hard work, Dr. Hahn finally succeeded in developing new varieties of cassava.\nThey yielded much more than the local ones and could survive diseases.",
        "3": "Another obstacle Dr. Hahn faced was distributing the new varieties.\nLocal farmers would not listen to a foreigner.\nTo overcome this problem, Dr. Hahn visited markets, churches, and schools and gave out the new varieties to Nigerian people for free.\nHe went from one house to the next to let farmers know the superiority of these new varieties.\nSometimes he planted them in the middle of the cassava field without telling the farmers.\nHis colleagues were concerned that the farmers might be angry to find different cassava in their fields.\nHowever, Dr. Hahn insisted that the farmers would think that it was a gift from God.\nHe was right.\nThe farmers soon realized the superiority of the new varieties, and more and more farmers started to cultivate them.\nThanks to the new cassava, fewer people were starving.\nIn fact, they could even make more money by selling the remaining cassava.\nEventually, Nigeria became the country that produced the greatest amount of cassava in the world.\nIn 1983, the Yoruba, a major tribe of Nigeria, honored Dr. Hahn as a chief with the title \"Seriki Agbe\" or \"the King of Farmers.\"",
        "4": "In addition to cassava, Dr. Hahn developed other major foods, including yam, sweet potato, and banana.\nSoon, other African countries asked for his help.\nDr. Hahn traveled to these countries to teach local farmers and scholars how to grow these new varieties.\nHe spent 23 years developing and distributing the new cassava varieties to the whole continent.\nAlthough he left Nigeria in 1994, he is still remembered as one of the greatest scientists who fought against starvation in Africa.\nDr. Hahn once said, \"If you have faith that what you do will benefit humanity, I believe that you must sacrifice yourself.\nEven if I were to go back to the past, I would still do the same thing.\""

        "2": "《Importance of Coral Reefs》\nCoral reefs are crucial ecosystems that protect both marine life and people living near the sea.\nCoral reefs provide shelter to an abundance of marine life, such as fish and underwater plants.\nBecause of the diversity of life found in coral reefs, they are often called \"the rainforests of the sea.\"\nNearly one quarter of all known marine species depend on coral reefs for survival ─ they hide themselves from predators, find food, reproduce, and raise their young in coral reefs.\nAs far as humans are concerned, over half a billion people rely on coral reefs for safety and survival.\nWhen large waves generated by storms rush toward shore, coral reefs serve as natural barriers.\nThe force of the waves is reduced as they hit the coral reefs.\nConsequently, they prevent the land on the shore from washing away and thus protect towns near the sea.\nMoreover, reefs are a source of medicine, and many organisms found in coral reefs are used to treat diseases like cancer.\nThis is why they are sometimes referred to as the \"medicine chests of the sea.\"",
        "3": "《Coral Reefs in Danger》\nThese underwater treasures are under threat of destruction.\nThe more coral reefs become damaged, the more creatures relying on them will lose their homes.\nThus, the increasing loss of coral reefs might lead to the destruction of the entire marine ecosystem.\nThe U.N. reported that many of the world's coral reefs are currently endangered.\nIn fact, nearly half of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest, has disappeared.\nIf swift action is not taken, scientists estimate that most coral reefs will be destroyed by 2050.\nWhat causes coral reefs to die?\nThere are various causes, like destructive fishing techniques, overpopulation of corals' natural enemies, and careless tourism.\nHowever, the leading cause is the rise in water temperature due to global warming.\nThe ideal temperature range for corals to live is 20'C to 28'C.\nWhen the water temperature rises above 30'C, coral reefs turn white and eventually die.\nAnother serious cause is plastic waste.\nPlastic products, such as bottles and fishing lines, have been dumped into the sea.\nThis spreads viruses and diseases, damaging coral reefs and their inhabitants.",
        "4": "《Technologies to Save Coral Reefs》\nIn recent years, advanced technologies have been put in place to save coral reefs by monitoring, protecting, and restoring them in quick and efficient ways.\nResearchers from Florida introduced a soft jellyfish-like robot to monitor coral reefs without damaging their delicate bodies.\nIn addition, an Australian research team invented an intelligent underwater robot to protect coral reefs from a dangerous species of starfish.\nThe robot uses a camera and computerized vision system to scan the reefs and identify this starfish.\nWhen it encounters one, the robot uses a foldable arm to inject some toxic salt into the starfish and eliminate it.\nMeanwhile, 3D printing systems have been proposed in Hong Kong as one way to restore coral reef structures.\nThe 3D printer creates artificial support for corals.\nAn example is a block made of mud that lies on the floor of the ocean.\nIt is shaped in a way that allows corals to attach to it and grow easily.",
        "5": "《Actions to Save Coral Reefs》\nHere are some simple but effective steps we can take in order to help protect coral reefs.\nFirst, you can avoid using beauty products containing tiny pieces of plastic because they pollute the oceans.\nAlso, try not to use sunscreen made with certain chemicals that damage corals.\nSecond, you can volunteer to help clean the beach.\nRecycling and reducing trash is a huge help in maintaining a clean ocean.\nLast but not least, make it known that coral reefs are in danger by spreading the word to people around you.\nLet people know about the threat to coral reefs and what actions to take to save them.\nThis will make a big difference for the future."

        "2": "According to the Internet, depending on the species and their location, cicadas spend different amounts of time underground.\nMost species emerge annually, but there are others that come out at longer intervals.\nThe magicicadas in Bloomington emerge every 17 years, but ones in other regions can have intervals of 13 or 17 years.\nThen, it hit me: 13 and 17 are prime numbers.\nI remembered learning in math class that a prime number is any natural number larger than 1 and is only divisible by 1 and itself.\nFor example, the prime numbers below 20 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.\nI never imagined that there are mathematical patterns in nature.\nI wonder why magicicadas emerge in intervals of prime numbers.",
        "3": "《May 23.》\nI have been thinking about the relationship between prime numbers and the number of years magicicadas live underground.\nSo, I did some more research, and this is what I found.\nIt seems that emerging in prime number intervals minimizes their exposure to predators.\nTheir predator populations also have cycles, such as a cycle of two, three, four, or six years.\nIf magicicadas followed a non-prime number cycle, for example, a cycle of 12 years, magicicadas would come across predators with a cycle of three years five times every 60 years.\nHowever, magicicadas with a cycle of 17 years would come across predators whose cycle is three years only once every 60 years.\nThat is, by emerging every 17 years, magicicadas minimize these deadly encounters because 17 is a prime number.\nThe way nature works is amazing!",

        "2": "《The Roman Arena》\nArles is an ancient city dating back to Roman times.\nMany Roman buildings remain, including an arena that was built in 90 A.D.\nThe arena used to seat over 20,000 people who would go to watch various entertaining events.\nVincent sometimes went to the bullfights that were held in the arena every Sunday.\nHe particularly liked to watch the colorful crowds.\nHe told a friend that he found the crowds fascinating.\nThey inspired the painting Arena at Arles.\nThe arena is in the top right corner of the painting and is barely visible.\nBelow, there is a faint image of two bulls.\nHowever, Vincent paid lots of attention to the people and their colorful clothes.\nSome of the people are chatting with friends, others are cheering on the bulls, and the entire painting has a powerful energy.",
        "3": "《Cafe van Gogh》\nVincent painted the world-famous Cafe Terrace at Night in September 1888.\nHe created this work while sitting outside the Cafe van Gogh at night.\nThis was unusual because most painters did their night scenes from memory and worked during the daytime.\nAs such, they used a lot of black paint.\nVincent, however, believed that night scenes contained diverse and vibrant colors.\nIndeed, the Cafe Terrace at Night has such a rich harmony of yellows, blues, and oranges that Vincent did not have to use a single drop of black paint.\nEven today, there is still a cafe at the site of Vincent's painting.\nIt was renovated in the 1990s and painted yellow to look like the cafe in the painting.\nHowever, it is uncertain whether the color of the original cafe was yellow or not.\nThe reason is that Vincent painted the wall of the cafe yellow to show the lamp light.",
        "4": "《Former Arles Hospital》\nIn December 1888, Vincent suffered from a mental illness and was sent to the hospital in Arles.\nHe stayed there for five months.\nDuring this time, his mental stability improved, and the doctors allowed him to paint outdoors.\nVincent took advantage of this freedom and produced several beautiful landscapes, such as The Garden of the Hospital in Arles.\nThe picture illustrates a spring garden filled with flowers and trees with different colors and tones.\nThe flowers are in full bloom, and the small trees are leafy.\nThe big trees, however, have few leaves.\nThis is rather odd given that the season is spring.\nPerhaps this contrast reflects the painter's complex feelings during the most difficult time of his life.\nThe hospital closed in the 1980s, and the building reopened as a library and exhibition space, with a cafe and gift shops.\nThe garden was renovated to resemble Vincent's painting as much as possible.",
        "5": "Arles and its provincial countryside inspired Vincent to create brighter, more exciting landscapes.\nHe had searched for brighter colors and softer light in Paris.\nIn Arles, he found them.\nToday, more than 200 years later, this beautiful city remains just as attractive.\nThe combination of Roman historic sites and Vincent's story creates a unique mood that will inspire you just as the city had inspired Vincent."

        "2": "Worth over $3 trillion and making up 2% of the world's GDP, the fashion industry today has an almost entirely linear approach.\nThe process moves in a straight line from design to consumption to disposal.\nMaterial extraction, textile manufacturing, the supply chain, design, sales, marketing, and other steps are guided by the aim of maximizing garment consumption without considering other issues.\nDue to linear fashion, the fashion industry negatively affects the environment.\n85% of textiles go into landfills, only 1% of the material is recycled, at least 500,000 tons of microfibers end up in the ocean (equal to 50 billion plastic bottles), and 93 billion cubic meters of water is required for textile production annually.\nAlarming numbers like these will keep increasing if producers maintain the old system.\nIt is clear that waste and pollution from the fashion industry must be reduced.\nLinear fashion must change, and this could happen through circular fashion.",
        "3": "Circular fashion is inspired by the principles of a circular economy and sustainable development.\nA circular economy is based on limiting waste, keeping resources and materials in use, and reusing them.\nIn a circular model, we make, use, and reuse materials for as long as possible to extract their maximum value.\nTherefore, clothing and textiles are produced, used, and reused to minimize waste.\nIt is a renewable approach to reduce the fashion industry's environmental impact.\nCircular fashion provides numerous benefits.\nFirst, extending the lifespan of fibers significantly reduces textile waste, benefiting the environment.\nSecond, circular processes utilize chemicals and materials safe for human health and the environment.\nThis practice protects the environment and consumer health.\nThird, materials are regenerated instead of being disposed of, which enables their long-term use.",
        "4": "The rise of circular fashion is facilitated by new technology and ideas.\nMaterials commonly used in clothing are not eco-friendly because they require considerable resources and often break down slowly.\nThis creates a need for eco-friendly textile alternatives.\nCurrently, companies are developing recycled fibers and fibers extracted from agricultural waste products like leaves, peels, and seeds.\nOne company uses nanotechnology to make soft material from orange peels.\nAnother makes fabrics from kapok tree seeds.\nThe trees grow well in poor soil without needing much water.\nThese new fabrics produce less waste, last a long time, and break down easily.\nIn addition to these manufacturing techniques, technology will improve in such a way that it may become normal to produce clothes only when people order them.\nThis \"make-to-order\" method will cost more, but then less money will be spent on maintaining offline stores.\nAnd 3D technology will enable people to see how clothes will fit online without trying them on in a store.\nIn the long run, innovation in production and sales will facilitate sustainable fashion and considerably reduce material waste and logistics emissions.",
        "5": "Another key to making fashion sustainable is the consumer: us.\nIf we want the fashion industry to adopt more sustainable practices, we must care about how clothes come to us.\nWe should then demonstrate our concerns through what we buy.\nThe market, of course, will respond.\nWe can also reduce waste by discarding clothes responsibly.\nTo be specific, we should buy only what we need and pass clothing on to someone who will wear it or to a thrift shop when discarding it.\nCircular fashion will not solve every problem in the fashion industry overnight.\nHowever, small steps in the right direction are better than nothing.\nKeeping things in the supply chain for as many cycles as possible is really important.\nBy making small changes to our clothing habits today, the fashion industry will gradually improve.\nAfter all, nothing is more fashionable than saving the planet."

        "1": "《Fake or Fact, That Is the Question》\nBritish writer Oobah Butler wanted to experiment with how easily one can manipulate public opinion online.\nHe created a fake restaurant called The Shed at Dulwich.\nButler set up an account for his \"restaurant\" on a popular online review site.\nHe did not provide an exact address and wrote it was reservations only.\nHe did this to make people think The Shed was a special restaurant.",
        "2": "He faked photos of The Shed's food with shaving cream, whitening tablets, and even his own foot.\nHe then asked his friends to write favorable fake reviews on the review site.\nThings quickly got, in Butler's words, \"a little out of hand.\"\nFrom the lowest of the charts of the review site, The Shed continuously climbed the London rankings.\nHe started getting e-mails and phone calls requesting reservations.\nInterest further increased when he told callers The Shed was \"fully booked for the next six weeks.\"\nEven funnier, food suppliers started guessing The Shed's address and sent him free samples, and many job applications came in.\nThese things happened without Butler serving a single meal.\nThe Shed eventually became London's number-one restaurant on one of the most trusted restaurant review sites.\nAccording to Butler, The Shed held that ranking for two weeks.",
        "3": "Butler's story shows that much of what we see on the Internet cannot be trusted.\nThis emphasizes the importance of digital literacy.\nDigital literacy is about more than just using computers.\nIt is the ability to use digital technology to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information.\nTo become digitally literate, we need to develop an attitude and knowledge that enable us to detect false information online.\nFalse information is any information that misinforms or deceives people.\nIt can be about anything such as health, the environment, and economics across many platforms.\nIt can be influential, as The Shed incident shows.\nIf people had been digitally literate, they would not have been fooled by The Shed experiment so easily.\nDigitally literate people would have carefully considered information about The Shed without being distracted by other people's reactions.\nThey would have been suspicious that the restaurant did not have an address.\nThey would have wondered why reviews on the restaurant did not appear in other more credible media.\nIf they had done these things, they would likely have suspected that something was not right.",
        "4": "Fortunately, The Shed incident was an experiment that caused little damage.\nHowever, false information can cause emotional or financial harm to people.\nFor example, false information about a certain gender or belief group can stir up hatred against that group.\nIt can cause fights between those who support the group and those who do not.\nIn addition, misleading online reviews about questionable products often trick people into wasting money.\nTo avoid being deceived by false information, we need to develop a habit of critically evaluating what we see online.\nIf you see a story that looks too good or too bad to be true, check the source first.\nLook at the website the story comes from.\nDoes it look real?\nAre there spelling errors?\nDoes it have other stories or just the one you read?\nCheck that the story contains references and links to other information.\nClick on those links and see if the other information looks reliable.\nWebsites with false information often do not have many real stories about other topics.\nThey also often have lots of advertisements that pop up when you visit the sites.",
        "5": "You should then check the credibility of the content creator.\nIf a story has no writer's name, this could be a sign that its content is questionable.\nIf there is a name, find out what and where the person has reported before.\nIf the person has not written anything else or writes for a website that looks unreliable, think twice before believing the content.\nFinally, check who else is reporting the story.\nIf no other media are reporting the same story, the story may not be true.\nPick a few keywords from the story and put them in a search site to see if other media are supporting the story.\nSorting through the vast amount of information created and shared online is challenging.\nHowever, it is important that we know what false information is and how it spreads.\nThe better we recognize false information, the better we will be at avoiding it and helping others do the same."
